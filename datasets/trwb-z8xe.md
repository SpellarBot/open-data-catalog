These onerous rules put an unnecessary and unsustainable burden on local manufacturers. The rules do not address the real air quality problems facing Portland. Instead they target small businesses that do not produce large tax revenues. Bullseye and Uroboros are known around the world as businesses that make quality glass, ethically and locally. These rules are focused only on these small local business and not large producers of chemicals which there is such sudden concern over, such as any number of other glass manufacturers (consider alcohol bottling?). Lest we forget the incredibly high levels of car and truck exhaust inhaled daily, but this is not a concern for the DEQ-but art glass-that's where we draw the line now? These onerous new rules come less than a week after the DEQ found NO evidence that heavy metal emissions were causing harm. The DEQ found NO evidence of harmful levels of arsenic, chromium or cadmium in schools. It appears these rules are being introduced merely to calm public opinion. These companies have made beautiful glass in Portland for forty years. I'm afraid that if these rules will drive them out of business. Certainly their employees locally will be harmed and the ripple of these changes will be felt by the art glass community around the world. I don't understand. I thought Oregon supported the arts. I thought Portland supported local businesses and workers. I have never been more disappointed to call Portland home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [null, null, null, null] |

DEQ seems to believe that investigations of impairments to our air, water and soil aren't really worth bothering about; and that since the public is alarmed at this one particular instance -- art glass manufacturers in Portland -- a very specific patch on existing regulations is all that's needed. This would completely miss the point. The public needs a more vigorous DEQ and a Department director more zealous for the health of the public and of our natural resources. We need an agency that actively seeks out impairments that compromise our environment and human health, and then acts with resolve to alleviate them. As an Oregonian living near a railroad company's creosote-emitting tie plant, I see, smell and feel (have headaches) the impacts of impaired air quality on a regular basis. DEQ has done nothing substantial to support my community's health or environmental integrity. So it comes unfortunately as no surprise that the agency was so lax in seeking out heavy metal contamination in Portland neighborhoods. The human beings in my community, as in the Portland neighborhoods near the glass manufacturers, just don't seem to matter to DEQ. It should not take front-page news articles to motivate DEQ employees and leaders to do their jobs! I strongly urge DEQ officials to reform their agency into one that stands up to polluters, and stands up for the health of Oregonians first and foremost. I ask DEQ not to begin regulating a few heavy metals from a specialized manufacturing sector in Portland, but rather to strengthen all harmful heavy metals emitted by all industries -- indeed, by any sources -- in all Oregon cities and towns.

To date, Bullseye has been arrogant and shown no contrition. The company refuses to even accept that the emissions measured are coming from their factory, despite the evidence. I would contrast Bullseye to Urorburos, which reached an agreement with DEQ to limit emissions voluntarily. I sincerely hope that we do not now see a watered down version of rules that have been bent to Bullseye's wants. Please do not put business interests over public health and safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [null, null, null, null] |

I support your temporary rules but would like to see them broad enough to include protection from the next potential polluter. My family has lived about 10 blocks from Bullseye Glass for the past 28 years. Well over a year ago my doctor found some metals in my system. Mercury was finally gone but the cadmium persisted. "What do I need to change? Where is it coming from?" I asked my doctor. "The environment. Food. It's hard to tell," he answered. Next to hit our family was the threat of prostate cancer and cadmium is a very high common denominator. And I will always be wondering about my good friend and neighbor (who lived here for 30 years) and recently died of kidney cancer. He was in his 50's. Thank you for working on this toxics issue with all due haste. This is not just a matter of statistics.
