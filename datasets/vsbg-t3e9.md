## Description

This dataset provides the public an opportunity to review the measures of each city department and helps to maintain open communication and transparency with Austin residents. It is the dataset form of the online database, ePerformance Measures, found on the City?s website here: http://www.austintexas.gov/budget/eperf/index.cfm. The City of Austin is committed to providing the highest quality services to our community members. As efforts to be the most livable and best managed city in the country continue, this dataset provides valuable information needed to sustain service levels, strive for excellence, and continue improvement.
