## Description

The Cook County Commission on Women’s Issues hosts an annual public hearing to address issues faced by women and girls in Cook County. The primary purpose of the hearing is educational.  The plan is to use the information gathered to develop a set of recommendations for action by the County Board and other interested parties. The Commission issues a Public Hearing Report based on information presented by speakers and research which offers both insight and recommendations for change, including recommendations for how County government may assist or participate in facilitating necessary change.

| The Realities of Human Trafficking in Cook County: Strategies for Ending the Exploitation of Women and Girls | The Commission selected this topic because of the increased attention the media has given to human trafficking. Furthermore, the city of Chicago has been labeled a national hub for human trafficking because its large airport, central geographic location, and elaborate transportation infrastructure make it an ideal port of entry. Unfortunately, majority of the victims of human trafficking are women and girls. The Commission recruited speakers to provide testimony on the impact that trafficking has upon women and girls, the extent of local involvement, and strategies for change. Speakers included survivors and individuals representing government agencies, community-based organizations, and law enforcement.                                                                 | 2007-10-01T00:00:00 | [null, null]                                                                                                                                                                               | [http://opendocs.cookcountyil.gov/womens-commission/hearing-reports/human-trafficking-report.pdf, 2007 Public Hearing Report]                                                            | [http://opendocs.cookcountyil.gov/womens-commission/hearing-reports/Human-Trafficking-Flyer.pdf, 2007 Human Trafficking Flyer]           | [null, null]                                                                                                                                   | [null, null]                                                                                                                                                                                            |
