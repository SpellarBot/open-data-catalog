I have been involved in the energy industry for over 20 years.  In my career I have never seen a solution that is more misguided than ethanol mandates.  It is basically a policy of using oil, water and pesticides to create a similar fuel output in terms of energy content.  I am strongly against any policy that does not deliver at least a 2-3 x EROEI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested) and ethanol struggles ot get a 1:1 EROEI.  Please stop subsidizing a inefficient fuel.

| 1415223636  | Alan       | Journet   | alanjournet@gmail.com   | Southern Oregon Climate Action Now    | Oregon | I write on behalf of over 700 activists with Southern Oregon Climate Action Now. Especially after the results of November 4th, when climate deniers were returned to DC from across the nation, it is very clear that we cannot expect very much leadership on the global warming / climate chaos front from Washington. Since greenhouse gas emissions from transportation consistently appear in the top three causes of such emissions, it is necessary that we do whatever we can to reduce those emissions. One way to do this s to reduce the carbon concentration in fuels. Efforts to implement the clean fuel standards of 2009 House Bill 2186 are applauded by all those across the state who care about the livability f the planet for future generations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                 |

We have a short window of time to make the changes necessary to keep our climate livable. Reducing carbon emissions from transportation is crucial, and will result in many other co-benefits such as cleaner air and local job creation. As such, I urge you to adopt these rules.

My motorcycles do not run on that stuff. My wife and I drove across country to SD and MT this past spring, we got the best fuel economy our 2012 Camry ever got...no ethanol fuel. You are wasting more gas than you are saving. I get 20% less fuel economy with ethanol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                 |

It will unfairly penalize lower-income Oregonians who pay a larger share of their income on transportation, and will punish small businesses that are sensitive to high fuel costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                 | 
| 1415310152  | Jim        | Edelson   | edelson8@gmail.com      |                                       | oregon | A critical responsibility of state government is to set product standards for market products within its jurisdictional authority. Motor vehicle fuels are no different. It is the reponsibility, indeed the duty, of Oregon to set appropriate standards for fuels puchased and consumed by its residents. The Clean Fuels Program (CFP) does exactly this ??? and does so in a way that meets the framework set forth by the Legislature to implement such rules. My comments will address one factor in the framework ??? imapact on consumers and the economy of Oregon. As a matter of disclosure, I was honored to serve as alternate member of the Phase 1 Advisory Committee for the Carbon Fuel Standard. Much analysis has been provided by opponents of the CFP. As is well known, the appropriateness of their methodology ??? and the subsequent economic and price impact analysis - has been questioned. One interesting facet of this is that the results produced from their analysis provide wide ranges of impact on the price per gallon of gas ??? but the sponsors of the research nearly always choose to publicize and testify solely on price impacts that exceed $1.00 per gallon. Of course, the independent analyses conducted by the state and its consultants show much more limited impacts on gas prices ??? up to a maximum of 19 cents over 10 years. This lower price impact band is corroborated by similar research conducted for the California Air Resources Board. As a result, independent econometric models done for the CFP rulemaking accurately reflect net positive benefits for Oregon???s economy. It should be intuitive that when market incentives for in-state industry and a cleaner environment are combined with an improved balance of trade, better economic conditions result. DEQ and EQC should deliberately move forward with the proposed rules to set an important product standard with the CFP. Proper product standards for motor vehicle fuels will benefit Oregon???s economy and environment ??? and they should not be derailed by unsubstantiated claims of its opponents. The Legislaure will have the opportunity to address the fate of CFP in 2015 ??? do not deprive them of full decision-making scope in this matter. | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                 |
