Prior to Yr End FY14 our number had excluded school groups, and other specialized groups, etc. Our previously recorded FY14 Target of 220,000 reflected our previous counting method. Our FY14 attendance started modestly in July but experienced a significant bump in September thanks to our small but critically acclaimed Cyrus Cylinder exhibition. Later in the Spring our special exhibition Yoga: The Art of Transformation brought in large crowds during its final month thanks in part to a successful public programming schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                             |                             | E Culture & Recreation             | Yes                               | No                 | Yes         | Yes                         | Yes                 | No                           |

The AAM's public programs are created in association with the special exhibitions with the purpose of deepening an understanding of Asian art and culture and to enhance the museum experience through meaningful engagement in programs such as cultural celebrations, performances, gallery talks, lecture demonstrations, artist engagements, evening mixer programs, art making, docent tours for adults and children, and storytelling. In FY 14 our public programs were able to showcase the cultural diversity of our special exhibitions. Japanese, Persian, Korean, Indian, and Contemporary Art were all celebrated. |                             | E Culture & Recreation             | Yes                               | No                 | No          | No                          | Yes                 | No                           |
