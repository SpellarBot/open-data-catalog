It is called the ""starry night"" beetle in China due to its coloration. The antennae are longer than the beetle's body and are banded black-and-white. Adults may be crawling over the trunks and branches of host trees, or possibly flying. There are several native beetles which are roughly the same size and color as ALB, so any suspicious beetles should be captured if at all possible and placed in a jar or film canister (NOT plastic bags - they'll chew through!). Place a label that includes the address and date inside the container and notify the Oregon Department of Agriculture." t:larva_description="The larvae are creamy white and develop inside the host tree. They may grow up to 2.4 inches long." t:damage="ALB larvae are wood borers and feed in both the sapwood and heartwood. Unlike most longhorned beetles, ALB is a serious pest of hardwoods because it can attack and kill healthy, as well as stressed, trees." t:common_name="Asian longhorned beetle (ALB)" t:photo_2=33nX1O_kcZ5-UQF12xE4yJqxead2A9V8Hp2BQ8dPUjY t:trap_info="Until an effective trap is developed, surveys for ALB are visual." t:scientific_name="Anoplophora glabripennis" t:photo=wKBtp2lqF9gIdlN8UEQ29FFienTgBxxwyQHBBWxnRBE t:distribution="Currently there are infestations in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey." m:row_number.x8zx-ge4b=1

Both are small ants, mostly about 1/8-inch long. Males and queens are larger. BIFA are all dark-brown to black, while RIFA have the forebody reddish-brown and the abdomen dark-brown to black.There are many ants that appear similar to IFA. Two other aggressive mound-building ants in Oregon are harvester ants and thatch ants. Harvester ants are found in eastern Oregon in areas that are too dry for IFA, which require sources of water. Thatch ants are found in western Oregon, but they are larger than IFA. Both ants have mounds with visible entrances. Neither of these ants sting as fiercely or are as aggressive as IFA. A common non-aggressive mound building ant in western Oregon is the mud ant, which makes somewhat columnar mounds in seasonally wet areas. Microscopic examination by entomologists is normally necessary to confirm the identity of suspected IFA. Mounds: Mounds vary in size depending on the size of the colony. Usually they are about 18 inches across and 8 to 12 inches tall. The ants tend to build mounds in open, sunlit, grassy areas near irrigation or other water sources. Mounds in sandy soil tend to be irregularly shaped and mounds in clay soils tend to be symmetrical and dome shaped." t:larva_description="The larvae are generally not visible above ground." t:damage="Gardens and Fields - Occasionally they feed on vegetable plants - the worst damage usually occuring during hot, dry weather. The ants seek out compost piles and mulched flower beds for warmth and moisture during cooler months.     Homes and Other Structures - Fire ants can form colonies close to homes and other buildings. During the hot, summer months they sometimes search indoors for food and moisture. Entire colonies may nest in wall voids or rafters, sometimes moving into buildings during floods. IFA may form colonies in potted plants forcing quarantines on shipments of plants from greenhouses and nurseries to other non-infested areas. They also nest under cracked pavement, removing dirt from underneath sidewalks and roadways and aggravating structural problems. Such colonies may be difficult to locate.   Electrical Equipment - Like many other ants, fire ants frequently infest electrical equipment. They chew on insulation causing short circuits and even fires. They interfere with switching mechanisms and can damage air conditioners, traffic signal boxes and other devices. Fire ants sometimes nest in housings around electrical and utility units. The ants move soil into these structures, which causes shorting and other problems." t:common_name="Imported fire ant (IFA)" t:trap_info="Bait such as SPAM luncheon meat or pelleted cat food are placed in small plastic baskets and set at intervals along the ground at high risk sites." t:scientific_name="Solenopsis invicta" t:photo=kz8owccBh51VnDBYt3Jq74jP4Iz5QQpAZOk_KZueekA t:distribution="IFA were originally introduced into Mobile, Alabama around 1920. There are two kinds of IFA, Black Imported Fire Ants (BIFA), Solenopsis richteri, and Red Imported Fire Ants (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta. Both species of imported fire ants are native to South America. IFA were originally introduced into Mobile, Alabama around 1920. At this time, BIFA only infests Alabama and Mississippi. The rest of the U.S. infestation is due to RIFA.   IFA is firmly established in the southeastern United States, extending north to North Carolina, west to eastern Texas, and two southern California counties. Isolated infestations, which have been eradicated, have occurred in several eastern and southwestern states. Recent outbreaks have been found in New Mexico, California, and Nevada. One of these outbreaks in California was associated with honey bees from Texas that were brought in for almond orchard pollination in Stanislaus County. Efforts are underway to eradicate infestations in those states. Fire ants have now spread to eleven California counties spanning the southern part of the state northward to Sacramento County. Some of these infested counties have nurseries that are known to ship their plants to Oregon." m:row_number.x8zx-ge4b=2

The wingspan is about 1.5 inches (38 mm).  Adult female: wings are creamy white with dark bands across the forewings. The wingspan is about 2 inches (51 mm)." t:larva_description="Mature larvae are brownish-black and covered with light hairs. Along their backs they have five pairs of blue bumps followed by six pairs of red bumps. A yellow line runs along the back from the head to the last body segment." t:damage="Gypsy moth are one of the most destructive insects of hard and softwood trees. The larvae can cause substantial defoliation that may lead to tree mortality. Defoliated forests are susceptible to disease, fire, and erosion, and may provide a poor habitat for other forms of animal and plant life. Not only do they strip trees and shrubs of foliage, they can be a nuisance to people when they crawl on sidewalks, patios, houses, and other structures, and when they create a continuous rain of messy droppings under infested trees. In some cases, people develop an allergy to the hairs of the gypsy moth larvae." t:common_name="Gypsy moth" t:photo_2=cCzhGF-1Iu_8kjSZ60eM9StycYb2vQtNpP-KX25xQN8 t:trap_info="The traps are tent-shaped, made of heavy paper, and are orange-red or lime green in color." t:scientific_name="Lymantria dispar" t:photo=beivh0yKI3q8QynvLW52o23SPk38irBaK54p0FGMYYM t:distribution="Gypsy moth is distributed in the northeastern states including Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Parts of Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are also infested with gypsy moth. Isolated infestations have also appeared in states outside the northeastern region such as Oregon, California, and Washington." t:trap=Cbi2znRbQH_aUNZ7BlV3Kzh_OSt6A5n98CwCoFD38WQ m:row_number.x8zx-ge4b=3

It is called the "starry night" beetle in China due to its coloration. The antennae are longer than the beetle's body and are banded black-and-white. Adults may be crawling over the trunks and branches of host trees, or possibly flying. There are several native beetles which are roughly the same size and color as ALB, so any suspicious beetles should be captured if at all possible and placed in a jar or film canister (NOT plastic bags - they'll chew through!). Place a label that includes the address and date inside the container and notify the Oregon Department of Agriculture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The larvae are creamy white and develop inside the host tree.

Both are small ants, mostly about 1/8-inch long. Males and queens are larger. BIFA are all dark-brown to black, while RIFA have the forebody reddish-brown and the abdomen dark-brown to black.There are many ants that appear similar to IFA. Two other aggressive mound-building ants in Oregon are harvester ants and thatch ants. Harvester ants are found in eastern Oregon in areas that are too dry for IFA, which require sources of water. Thatch ants are found in western Oregon, but they are larger than IFA. Both ants have mounds with visible entrances. Neither of these ants sting as fiercely or are as aggressive as IFA. A common non-aggressive mound building ant in western Oregon is the mud ant, which makes somewhat columnar mounds in seasonally wet areas. Microscopic examination by entomologists is normally necessary to confirm the identity of suspected IFA. Mounds: Mounds vary in size depending on the size of the colony. Usually they are about 18 inches across and 8 to 12 inches tall. The ants tend to build mounds in open, sunlit, grassy areas near irrigation or other water sources. Mounds in sandy soil tend to be irregularly shaped and mounds in clay soils tend to be symmetrical and dome shaped. | The larvae are generally not visible above ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | IFA were originally introduced into Mobile, Alabama around 1920. There are two kinds of IFA, Black Imported Fire Ants (BIFA), Solenopsis richteri, and Red Imported Fire Ants (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta. Both species of imported fire ants are native to South America. IFA were originally introduced into Mobile, Alabama around 1920. At this time, BIFA only infests Alabama and Mississippi. The rest of the U.S. infestation is due to RIFA. IFA is firmly established in the southeastern United States, extending north to North Carolina, west to eastern Texas, and two southern California counties. Isolated infestations, which have been eradicated, have occurred in several eastern and southwestern states. Recent outbreaks have been found in New Mexico, California, and Nevada. One of these outbreaks in California was associated with honey bees from Texas that were brought in for almond orchard pollination in Stanislaus County. Efforts are underway to eradicate infestations in those states. Fire ants have now spread to eleven California counties spanning the southern part of the state northward to Sacramento County. Some of these infested counties have nurseries that are known to ship their plants to Oregon. |                                             | Bait such as SPAM luncheon meat or pelleted cat food are placed in small plastic baskets and set at intervals along the ground at high risk sites.                                                  | [null, null] | Fire ants feed on a wide variety of food including insects, seeds, and seedlings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Gardens and Fields - Occasionally they feed on vegetable plants - the worst damage usually occuring during hot, dry weather. The ants seek out compost piles and mulched flower beds for warmth and moisture during cooler months. Homes and Other Structures - Fire ants can form colonies close to homes and other buildings. During the hot, summer months they sometimes search indoors for food and moisture. Entire colonies may nest in wall voids or rafters, sometimes moving into buildings during floods. IFA may form colonies in potted plants forcing quarantines on shipments of plants from greenhouses and nurseries to other non-infested areas. They also nest under cracked pavement, removing dirt from underneath sidewalks and roadways and aggravating structural problems. Such colonies may be difficult to locate. Electrical Equipment - Like many other ants, fire ants frequently infest electrical equipment. They chew on insulation causing short circuits and even fires. They interfere with switching mechanisms and can damage air conditioners, traffic signal boxes and other devices. Fire ants sometimes nest in housings around electrical and utility units. The ants move soil into these structures, which causes shorting and other problems. | no                 |

The larvae can cause substantial defoliation that may lead to tree mortality. Defoliated forests are susceptible to disease, fire, and erosion, and may provide a poor habitat for other forms of animal and plant life. Not only do they strip trees and shrubs of foliage, they can be a nuisance to people when they crawl on sidewalks, patios, houses, and other structures, and when they create a continuous rain of messy droppings under infested trees. In some cases, people develop an allergy to the hairs of the gypsy moth larvae.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | yes                |

The adults typically skeletonize leaves and leave behind large irregular holes, consume flowers, and devour fruit. The grubs develop in the soil feeding primarily on the roots of turf in lawns, parks, golf courses, and pastures, but will also feed on the roots of crops such as corn, beans, tomatoes, and strawberries. | The larvae feed primarily on the roots of turf in lawns, golf courses, and pastures, but will also feed on the roots of crops such as corn, strawberries, beans, and tomatoes. The adults feed on several hundred species of woody and herbaceous plants including maples, oaks, elms, fruit trees, grapes, berries, roses, and corn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | yes                |

They have been found to attack tomatoes in the laboratory. Because female SWD can lay many eggs and there can be many generations of SWD per year, populations could rapidly build to damaging levels. Infested fruit has already been found at an Oregon ?u-pick? site and in a market featuring local produce. Not just local sales of fruit could be affected. This fly?s presence in Oregon could lead to restrictions on shipping fresh fruit to the eastern US and possibly other uninfested countries.
