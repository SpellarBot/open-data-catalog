Using models based on physics can cost significantly less and provide reasonable estimates of benefits. Monitoring and accounting should not be overwhelm the cost of the program. DEQ's 2009 IMD provided a reasonable approach for using monitoring: "When a surrogate is allowed, DEQ may also require monitoring to establish the accuracy of the surrogate in representing the parameter for trading purposes as well as its effectiveness at achieving the water quality goal." | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                            |
