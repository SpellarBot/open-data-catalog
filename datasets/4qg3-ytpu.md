Red Flat Nickel Corporation and American Exploration and Mining Association, a large industry trade group, were among only 20 commenters that opposed the withdrawal. 

&acirc;&euro;&cent; More than 500 local citizens testified in favor of protecting local watersheds and rivers from nickel strip mining at public meetings hosted by the U.S. Forest Service and BLM in Grants Pass and Gold Beach in September of 2015.

&acirc;&euro;&cent; According to the U.S. EPA, metal mining is the most polluting industry in America.

&acirc;&euro;&cent; At risk are pure drinking water for local communities, wild river strongholds for salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat, public lands that support a treasure trove of botanical diversity, and outstanding outdoor recreation opportunities, including fishing, hiking, whitewater rafting and kayaking

&acirc;&euro;&cent; U.S. Senators Wyden (D-OR) and Merkley (D-OR) and U.S. Representatives DeFazio (D-OR) and Huffman (D-CA) introduced legislation, the Southwest Oregon Salmon and Watershed Protection Act, in February 2015 in response to the local community concerns about the threat of nickel strip mining to clean water and salmon runs in the area near the OR-CA border known as the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Wild Rivers Coast&acirc;&euro;&#65533;.

&acirc;&euro;&cent; The delegation requested that the US Forest Service and the Secretary of Interior implement the withdrawal for the &quot;full 20-year period to provide meaningful protection and to give Congress sufficient time to consider longstanding agency recommendations for the future management of these lands, new information regarding their values, and the public's sentiment and views.&quot; 

&acirc;&euro;&cent; In response to the request, the USFS and the BLM initiated a temporary two-year mineral withdrawal to gather public input and prepare the required analysis and reports. The USFS is expected to release an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposed withdrawal in April 2016." t:email_address=executivedirector@anws.org m:row_number.4qg3-ytpu=1

| 1458898430  | Lori       | Turbes    | loriturbes@yahoo.com       | Sundance Kayak School                 | OR         | The North Fork Smith River is a pristine gem to the whitewater community. I frequently kayak on this section of river and enjoy taking new kayakers down for their first time. Every time a new kayaker experiences the North Fork, they are extremely impressed and can't wait to return. Hundreds of small waterfalls enter the North Fork as you paddle downstream. There are thousands of the rare Darlingtonia Californica that thrive on the rivers banks. I was surprised when I saw a river otter on the upper portion of the North Fork. That was a first for me! The North Fork Smith is the headwaters for the Wild and Scenic Smith River in California. By designating the North Fork under the Outstanding Resources Waters, the complete river system has a chance to stay pristine and untouched by the strip mining threats. It would be such a shame to have the entire lower river system protected just to leave the most important headwaters section vulnerable to water contamination. Attached is a photo of the North Fork Smith River. Hundreds of kayakers each year travel near and far for a chance to float on this pristine river. If the EQC can designate the North Fork Smith River under the Outstanding Resource Waters, it will ensure that current and future generations can experience this rare, pristine river in it's entirety.

| 1458994124  | Jack       | Duggan    | shanachie@hughes.net       | Mr.                                   | Oregon     | The North Fork of the Smith River should receive designation as an Outstanding Resource Waters because of its contributions to multiple uses downstream. It is an economic driver in keeping pristine waters available for recreation and fishing. I fished the Smith as a young man and again after Vietnam. Driving the Hiouchi Gorge on a regular basis, I saw people stopping to admire and recreate on the river year-round. The values of maintaining the river in a pristine quality far outweigh any temporary benefits from exploitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [null, null, null, null]                                                                    |

The ORW designation would protect this resource from future pollution and degradation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [null, null, null, null]                                                                    |

I have been a paddler in Oregon for nearly 10 years and have been to the NF Smith River several times. I can say that the Smith River system is a unique and amazing resource worthy of the highest protection afforded by law. I have children 3 and 5 years - and can't wait to bring them camping, fishing and paddling in the smith river system. it is truly special and we owe it's protection to future generations! I will not sit idly by and allow its desecration via mining in the headwaters.
