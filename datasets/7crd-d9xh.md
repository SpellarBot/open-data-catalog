While in pursuit of knowledge about other world regions, including their histories, economies and world languages, students acquire the knowledge and skills needed to prepare for college and/or careers. Teachers and other adults who make up the learning community forge supportive relationships with students and parents while providing challenging and engaging learning experiences. Our school partners with various community, arts, and business organizations to help students achieve success. Our theme of international studies extends beyond the classroom, where students participate in ongoing ?Advisory Day Out? excursions where the multiculturalism of NYC becomes the classroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Global/International Studies in core subjects;

Do you like projects, working with your hands and learning by doing? How do you feel about field trips and being outdoors in all kinds of weather in all of the seasons? Are you creative, inquisitive, action-oriented, responsible, a positive risk-taker, collaborative, and conscientious? At Stephen T. Mather Building Arts & Craftsmanship High School (Mather HS), you will prepare for college and beyond through hands-on learning and skills training. With the National Park Service (NPS), our school offers CTE pathways in the specialized building arts or landscape management, all through the lens of historic preservation. You will build a strong academic foundation and learn solid trade skills, opening doors to a successful future.                                                                                                                                                                        | All ninth graders take an Introduction to Historic Preservation course with six field trips, and a survey of architecture, carpentry, masonry, decorative finishing, and landscape management. At the end of tenth grade, students choose one of the CTE pathways in either the Building Arts [Carpentry (woodworking), Masonry (stone/brick/plastering); Decorative Finishing (art/painting/ornamental work)] or Landscape Management. Both programs conclude with an internship and job shadowing with NPS or one of our other industry partners. All students experience field trips to partner sites such as Ellis Island, Governors Island and the Statue of Liberty.

Our college preparatory curriculum relies on our expertise in developing writers and building a tight-knit community. As we evolve and grow, Clinton remains committed to developing students who can think analytically and write creatively in a wide range of genres. Our arts programming builds on our 25 years of experience in visual, performing arts and music on a middle school level. We are also deepening our existing partnerships with Theater for a New Audience and the Whitney, and taking advantage of our proximity to new cultural partners. We are a International Baccalaureate (IB) candidate school. The IB program is a good fit for for the creative, confident, thoughtful, and self-motivated learners that have always been successful at Clinton. Beyond the IB, we will offer opportunities to take college courses at neighboring universities. | Free college courses at neighboring universities; International Travel, Special Arts Programs, Music, Internships, College Mentoring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                             |                     | CUNY College Now, Technology, Model UN, Student Government, School Leadership Team, Music, School Musical, National Honor Society, The Clinton Post (School Newspaper), Clinton Soup (Literary Magazine), GLSEN, Glee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                           |                                                                                               |                  | Cross Country, Track and Field, Soccer, Flag Football, Basketball                                                        | Unleashed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Whitney Museum, Theater for a New Audience, City Center, Dancing Classrooms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                               |                   |                                   |                                                                           | The 2016 cohort will attend school in our new permanent home on E. 15th Street, allowing students from all parts of the city easy access by way of public transportation.
