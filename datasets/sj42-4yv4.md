## Description

This data set contains the national average (mean) ?top-box? scores of Medicare-certified hospice agencies on Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS?) Hospice Survey measures. Top-box scores show the percent of respondents who gave the most positive responses for each measure.  Scores are calculated from survey responses of informal caregivers (i.e., family or friends) of patients who died while getting hospice care between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2016.
