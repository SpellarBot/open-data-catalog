SB 705 Asbestos Rule-Making Requirement mandating survey PRIOR to a residential demolition continues to be blindsided when it comes to beautiful treasured turn-of-the-century bungalows constructed in
Mixed Commercial zones; e.g., along SE Division, SE Hawthorne Blvd., and SE Belmont?    
 
Take for example:
 
Four Stories Proposed to Replace 1909 Hawthorne Home ...
www.portlandchronicle.com/four-stories-replace-106-year-old-hawthorn...
Jan 14, 2015 - Demolition Confirmed for 1909 Hawthorne Home, Protest Today ... Theproperty is located at 3423 SE Hawthorne Blvd. in the Sunnyside neighborhood. ... A sign on on the house reads &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Hawthorne Monkey Tail Apartments.&acirc;&euro;&#65533;.
 
I have been told, that Developer's sub-Contractor was not required to notify immediate property owners when to expect their dumpster to arrive,
giving a seven (7) day notice -- via a door-hanger.   Did I fail to mention, located next door to a open patio, where patrons sat eating meals?
 
Nor is the Developer's sub-Contractor required to issue protective eye/face masks, leather gloves for their demolition crews.  So at what point
does OSHA come into play here?
 
 
 
How?   DRAC start lobbying both the State of Oregon and the city of Portland to close the gap between citizen complaint calling for DEQ Inspectors completing their survey and BDS requesting DEQ documentation, prior to issuing the Developer a demolition permit regardless of the ZONE(S) existing.   Least I remind you, there were three zones under the new Southeast 101 condos constructed between Peacock Lane's backyard fences and SE Cesar E. Chavez Blvd. S.    
How difficult is it to included a RED CHECK OFF BOX STAMPED on the top of the existing BDS Demolition Permit forms?  
 
Final question, at what point will DRAC volunteers agree to bring this truly provocative and spirited discussion forward to the movers and shakes?  Do whatever it takes for DEQ and BDS to best alert immediate property owners that the demolition dumpsters are coming?   Surely, &quot;We the People&quot; have the right to know when to expect toxic asbestos and lead paint dust flying in the air they breathe.    
 
Your thoughts?

Has that been addressed with the committee?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                  |

Take for example: Four Stories Proposed to Replace 1909 Hawthorne Home ... www.portlandchronicle.com/four-stories-replace-106-year-old-hawthorn... Jan 14, 2015 - Demolition Confirmed for 1909 Hawthorne Home, Protest Today ... Theproperty is located at 3423 SE Hawthorne Blvd. in the Sunnyside neighborhood. ... A sign on on the house reads ???Hawthorne Monkey Tail Apartments.???. I have been told, that Developer's sub-Contractor was not required to notify immediate property owners when to expect their dumpster to arrive, giving a seven (7) day notice -- via a door-hanger. Did I fail to mention, located next door to a open patio, where patrons sat eating meals? Nor is the Developer's sub-Contractor required to issue protective eye/face masks, leather gloves for their demolition crews. So at what point does OSHA come into play here? How? DRAC start lobbying both the State of Oregon and the city of Portland to close the gap between citizen complaint calling for DEQ Inspectors completing their survey and BDS requesting DEQ documentation, prior to issuing the Developer a demolition permit regardless of the ZONE(S) existing. Least I remind you, there were three zones under the new Southeast 101 condos constructed between Peacock Lane's backyard fences and SE Cesar E. Chavez Blvd. S. How difficult is it to included a RED CHECK OFF BOX STAMPED on the top of the existing BDS Demolition Permit forms? Final question, at what point will DRAC volunteers agree to bring this truly provocative and spirited discussion forward to the movers and shakes? Do whatever it takes for DEQ and BDS to best alert immediate property owners that the demolition dumpsters are coming? Surely, "We the People" have the right to know when to expect toxic asbestos and lead paint dust flying in the air they breathe.

In order to conduct asbestos surveys/ inspections in the state of Colorado you had to be accredited as an EPA/ AHERA Building Inspector and pass a state exam. My brother-in-law works in northern California for an inspection company and they have to be accredited as an EPA/ AHERA Building Inspector and Contractor/Supervisor, pass a state exam to become a Certified Site Surveillance Technician and work under the supervision of a Certified Asbestos Consultant. I feel the state of Oregon should impose similar certification standards and mandate a state exam. Asbestos is a known carcinogenic, has killed many people and the EPA states there is no safe level. This not something to take lightly. NESHAP, MAP (ASHARA), OSHA and AHERA are the four major asbestos regulations, each is a different federal regulation with their own agendas. Asbestos regulations are not a simplistic as you might think. I concur with Mr. Baker's comment that everything should be tested, and have no square footage limit or limited number of dwellings per any project, because size is irrelevant for any asbestos fiber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                  |

It is essential for the health our community that verification of certified surveys and abatement activity should be required by Oregon DEQ and become part of the process before a residential demolition can proceed. ?? Additionally, there shoud be no year of construction cut-off date for requiring an asbestos survey before demolition, as it is logistically impossible to monitor and insure in all levels of construction that some residual component of asbestos is not present, and this should be preemptively rather than reactively approached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                  |

I live on Johnson Street in NW Portland. January 25, 2016 1100 demolitions have taken place in Portland in the last four years, with little protection of neighboring homes from extremely toxic asbestos. Neighbors are not warned to protect themselves and their children, and workers in recycling and other occupations handling the debris are unnecessarily exposed. Asbestos exposure is known to cause cancer. First, it is important that the current language, ???the owner or operator submit (an)??? asbestos survey report to DEQ upon DEQ???s request??? should be changed to ???Owners and operators proposing demolitions and renovations where asbestos is suspected (pre January 1, 2004) shall submit to pre demolition inspections by certified asbestos inspectors. Strike ???upon DEQ request???. Second, DEQ and BDS must coordinate their issuance of demolition permits to accommodate the pre demolition inspections. Third, All materials and debris from these sites must be disposed of under the direction of the Asbestos Inspectors. The rules should include clear directions regarding how and where asbestos debris is handled and disposed. Fourth, renovations of asbestos contaminated buildings should fall under the same scrutiny as the demolitions. Finally, it is unconscionable for Oregon DEQ to wait until 2017 to make these rules. Slack DEQ oversight in part led to lead in drinking water in Flint. Asbestos is a no brainer for causing public health concerns. Let???s ask DEQ to do the right thing for our state without delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                  |

Copies of supporting documents were submitted at the hearing too. I will also add that DEQ and BDS should coordinate between their agencies when BDS issues demolition and major alteration/addition permits so that hazmat abatements are verified and inspected before the building is disturbed/demolished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [application/vnd.ms-word.document.macroEnabled.12, 0780d4cb-475e-4f58-8448-da6025b898de, Final DEQ Testimony.docm, 17311] |
