## Description

The City of Austin and its affected departments estimate that necessary changes will need to be made to ensure safety for all upcoming festival events. This short survey helps us plan for the future. As instructed per city council resolution #20140327-036, City staff was asked to compile community feedback on events taking place during SXSW festival for a post-event evaluation.

I would think that when a city is chosen to host the Final Four or the Super Bowl that there is an agreement that the city will not allow unofficial or rogue event producers to set up competing events within a certain area. As official SXSW events are held at a variety of venues around the city, it would be difficult to create a SXSW registrant-only zone. But the city has to take a harder stance against the poacher promoters and the street hangers-out who aren't there to participate in SXSW at all, but threaten the future viability of a well-produced, well-planned international event. "Dirty Sixth" is an embarrassment, eyesore and public safety issue all year round, not just during SXSW season. |
