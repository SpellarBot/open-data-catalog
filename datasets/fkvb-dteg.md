Keep in mind that payments are only part of a department?s total expenditures. Expenditures include amounts for bills due but not yet paid, allocated overhead, and other adjustments.

| 1418221777  | aboutPage | At this time spendingMontgomery includes data for Montgomery County Government only; any data for other County Agencies can be accessed through http://www2.montgomerycountymd.gov/MCGAppPortal/departments.aspx#County_Agencies.
This site contains information about payments made by the County.
Departments listed in this site are the departments that actually made the payment. In some cases, one department may pay a bill on behalf of other departments. After the bill is paid, the charges are moved to the department that actually received the service or made the purchase. Therefore, departments listed in spendingMontgomery may not necessarily be the department whose budget is ultimately charged.
spendingMontgomery shows you the payments we have made. Keep in mind that payments are only part of a department?s total expenditures. Expenditures include amounts for bills due but not yet paid, allocated overhead, and other adjustments. Therefore, spending on this site will not necessarily match a department?s total actual expenditures listed in the budget publications or the County?s financial statements (Comprehensive Annual Financial Report).
Protected Data
Certain data fields have been scrambled due to the confidential or sensitive nature of the transaction. Although publicizing as much data as possible is the goal of this site, the County must protect certain information per contractual and legal requirements. The scrambled data will look like a long number, such as the vendor information in Figure 1?Examples of Scrambled Data on a drilldown and the invoice data in Figure 2?Examples of Scrambled Data on an Invoice.
