## Description

This is a daily extract from the Seattle Parks and Recreation class registration system. It contains data about activities and specific classes held at Seattle Parks and Recreation community centers, pools, rowing and sailing centers and other recreation courses. This dataset also contains the facility address, registration start dates and times, current opening as of the 'datatransferred' time, and registration fees. This dataset is refreshed at 10:15 am every day. The 'barcode_number' is the unique course identifier that is used for registration.
