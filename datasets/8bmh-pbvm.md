Located in the in I-80 Corridor in Will County in Chicago' s rapidly growing south suburbs, they were constructed in 2003 by TCB Development, the leading developer in this area. This location is attracting office and industrial users due to its convenient access to major interstate highways, its abundant labor force and its low taxes. The opening in November 2007 of the I-355 extension to I-80, provided this location with direct access to Chicago' s west and northwest suburbs. | Y                        | Office            | 0           | 12825           | 0                     | 0                   | 0               | 0            | 0                  | 0                 |                     | Office                |                         |            | Unknown           |                        | U                | U                   | None              | U                |                   |           |            | 17,527,000 |                               | Unknown          | 0               | 0                |                    |                     | 0                      | 0                    | 0                              | 0                | 0                          | 0          | U                          | 0          | U                     | 0                   | 0                     |                  |                         | 0                        | 0                             |                             | U                                           |                       | U                                 |                 | U               |                             | 0              |               |                                   |                                         | 0                  |         | 0                  | U      |                                   |                                         | 0                       | 0                               | 0                        |                                         |                                            |                      |                      | 0                 | 0                         | 0                                      | 0                  | U                  |                         |                               | 0                          | 0                                  | 0                                                     | U           |                    | I-80               | 1                                    | LaGrange Road          | 0.25                                     |                          | Midway                           | 16                                                 | OHare                      | 32                                           | Y                 | U                           | Main Line         |                              | U                         | 0                     |             | 0                        |                         | 0                        |          | 0                            | 0                                     | 0             | 0            |              | Tom Rusthoven   | CB Richard Ellis                    |                                 |              |               |             | 630-573-7049  |              |               |                             |                        | Ted Buenger            | CB Richard Ellis                    |                                 |                |                 |                      | 630-573-7091    |                        |                        |                        |              |                           |                    |                     |                |                  |                         |                |                  |                         |                |                  |                         |                |                  |                         | 2010-08-18T00:00:00 | jane                |               |
