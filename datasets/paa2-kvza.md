( Notes: SPONSOR: Council Member Mike Martinez, Co-sponsor 1: Council Member Kathie Tovo, Co-sponsor 2: Council Member Laura Morrison)                                                                                               | The City Council Special Committee on Economic Incentives made recommendations to Council regarding improvements to the City's existing Chapter 380 economic development policy. As a result of the recommendations the Economic Development Department (EDD) initiated a stakeholder process to identify the potential impact on small local contractors and develop proposals for mitigating the negative impacts of requiring the City's living wage on construction projects that are part of Chapter 380 economic development agreements. The group identified several impacts that could result from the policy revision including an increase in payroll costs, higher administrative and accounting costs and more expensive financing. Creating an accessible guaranteed loan program with a collateral pool could make contracting on City projects and Chapter 380 economic development agreement projects a more viable option for small businesses including City certified minority- and women-owned business enterprises(MBE/WBE). This resolution explores the feasibility of creating a guaranteed loan program, including a collateral pool for MBE/WBE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 
| 2013-10-24T00:00:00 | Economic Policy           | Approve a resolution to revise the Firm Based Incentive Matrix used to determine firm eligibility for economic development incentives as authorized by Chapter 380 of the Texas Local Government.

Additionally there is public benefit in including community values as a part of economic development agreements. To that end, based on the public feedback the City Council Special Committee on Economic Incentive recommended requiring companies entering into Chapter 380 Agreements to ensure compliance with the City's prevailing wage program for construction work funded by the Firm, the City's living wage for construction workers and employees that have permanent jobs with the company, and offer domestic partner and health insurance benefits for its employees as core values. The Committee recommended an exception process to the requirements of living wage, health insurance, and domestic partner benefits by providing an exceptions application that includes open communication about what community benefit could be considered in exchange for an exception. This resolution amends the Firm Based Incentive Matrix for Chapter 380 Agreement approval process and creates an exception application form.                                       |

( Notes: SPONSOR: Council Member Kathie Tovo, Co-sponsor 1: Council Member Laura Morrison, Co-sponsor 2: Council Member Mike Martinez) | Council adopted earlier resolutions which created a repeat offenders program of rental registration and supporting Code Compliance's goal of bringing violations to the Building and Standars Commission within 90 days as these initiatives aid the ongoing effort to ensure safer housing for Austin residents. This resolution builds on that work, directing the City Manager to review and evaluate the current City of Austin process for addressing code violations related to health and safety issues and crime at multi-family rental properties and explore code enforcement and criminal nuisance abatement practices in the cities of Dallas, Oakland, San Diego and others. The City Manager is directed to return to Council by April 2014 with recommendations for strengthening the City's response to such situations. The City Manager is further directed to consider an enhanced process with greater enforcement for properties with a demonstrated history of criminal activity and code violations. Additionally, proposal options such as low-interest financing to assist multifamily owners in rehabilitating properties to enable preservation of existing Affordable Housing. Lastly, the City Manager is directed to explore creating programs that help tenants to identfy dangerous or substandard conditions and that inform landlords of safe housing issues and crime preventions strategies. |
