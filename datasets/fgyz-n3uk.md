In the early 1970s instantaneous counts of over a thousand pinks were made, however since 1981 not more than 30 pinks have been seen on any one day. Numbers of spawners from 1989 to 1999 averaged only six. These numbers are so low that they may not represent a self-sustaining stock but may be strays from other stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                       | SCoRE, SOS   | 2016-07-31T00:00:00 |

Beginning in September 2012 after the removal of the lower dam, the National Park Service, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, and National Marine Fisheries Service conducted foot surveys between the Glines Powerhouse and the lower dam site. Two major tributaries, Little River and Indian Creek, and the lower mainstem below the Elwha Dam site to RM 2.3 were also included with these surveys. The HOS and NOS estimates for natural spawners were based on the proportion of Chinook that had either an otolith mark present (HOS) or an otolith mark absent (NOS). Jacks are not included in these estimates. |                                                                                                                                                                       | SCoRE, SOS   | 2016-07-31T00:00:00 |
