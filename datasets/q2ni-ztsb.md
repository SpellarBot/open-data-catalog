As of right now practice is being held 2 days a week for all players. As the teams grow and learn to play together we will begin to enter into more competitive play and tournaments. There will be a fee for each player, but it is our goal to keep the cost as low as possible for our players. In order to keep the fees as low as possible, we need your help. This is where you, the parents, come in. As we all know parents play a major role in everything that their child does, and we hope that you will show the same eagerness to support our league that you do other aspects of your child?s life. Being involved, takes effort, commitment, and a healthy dose of patience. It also means shuttling your children back and forth to practices and sneaking out of work early to attend games ? but that?s just the beginning. |                     |        |

We want to believe that giving these children an option, other than that of the one society paints for them, is what not only distinguishes us as an organization, but defines us. By giving the children opportunities that they probably would not have had otherwise our organization, 5 Boros Basketball, is based on acknowledging their talents, embracing and nurturing them and helping to shape them into successful individuals, whether it be in the sport of basketball or life itself. By giving them a place to go, with coaches who volunteer their time to teach and nurture each individual, 5 Boros Basketball is providing a stable environme! nt in which our youth can flourish.                       |                     |        |

The larger program will create more seats for students outside of those recruited from the Renaissance School itself. Staff members work with students to develop their social emotional skills, complete homework, engage in arts and STEM projects, learn about nutrition and receive a hot meal, learn about exercise and health, and appreciate or empower their experience of diversity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                     |        |
