## Description

This Officer-Involved Shooting dataset provides the raw data needed to better understand the characteristics of these incidents in APD's jurisdiction and by APD officers. It is used to assist in identifying training and procedure improvements to improve outcomes.

This report reflects all officer-involved shootings that occurred from 2006 through 2015 in Austin. It includes incidents in which APD or non-APD officers fired their weapons within the city of Austin as well as incidents in which APD officers fired their weapons outside the city of Austin.
Officer-involved shootings are defined as:
-an incident in which an officer fired his/her firearm intentionally at a subject;
-an incident in which an officer fired his/her firearm unintentionally and struck a subject; or
-an incident in which an officer used a less-lethal firearm, struck the subject, and contributed to the subject?s death.
