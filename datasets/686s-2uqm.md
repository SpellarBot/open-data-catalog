## Description

Description
A mill is equal to $1.00 of tax for each $1,000 of assessment. To calculate the property tax, multiply the assessment of the property by the mill rate and divide by 1,000. For example, a property with a assessed value of $50,000 located in a municipality with a mill rate of 20 mills would have a property tax bill of $1,000 per year.

 

Local property tax mill rates have been set for individual Connecticut municipalities for fiscal year 2013-2014. These rates are based upon the 2012 grand list and are available below. These are the most current mill rates and are reflected in each municipality's July 2013 tax bills
