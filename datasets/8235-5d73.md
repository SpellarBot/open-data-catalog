Use caution in comparing the 2008 estimates for the number of persons receiving fluoridated water and persons served by CWS for these states to estimates from 2002, 2004, and 2006 because a different vintage of U.S. Census population estimates was used. | WFRS_State_1 | 1          | 20                 | 1                 | 83.1         |

Use caution in comparing the 2008 estimates for the number of persons receiving fluoridated water and persons served by CWS for these states to estimates from 2002, 2004, and 2006 because a different vintage of U.S. Census population estimates was used.                                                                                                                                   | WFRS_State_1 | 11         | 20                 | 9                 | 100          |
