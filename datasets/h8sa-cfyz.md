I am writing today regarding the proposed water quality trading rules. I am very concerned that the proposed rules do not appear to include many basic elements to ensure protection of our public waterways, and look to avoid public scrutiny of pollution trades.

The rules do not place the primary emphasis on the protection of clean water, rather they start by focusing on economic incentives for the polluter. The proposed rules even go so far as allowing the polluter to write their own plan with very little clear guidelines from DEQ.

Water quality restoration plans (TMDLs) should be more clearly incorporated. These plans have specific assumptions regarding baseline site conditions that must be used properly in developing any permit to pollute, especially trades. 

The rules should identify all pollutants that DEQ is prepared to engage in trading for, rather than deferring to a case-by-case evaluation internally. If DEQ considers other pollutants safe for trading, they should all be outlined clearly in the rules.

Finally the rules do not give confidence that DEQ is able to clearly articulate what it considers acceptable in water quality trades by leaving all planning and assessment of how water quality would be benefited, how credit ratios are determined, and what methods are acceptable for monitoring success to the polluter.

DEQ should heavily revise the proposed rules &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; or go back to the drawing board entirely &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; to provide real certainty of expectations for polluters, and more detailed and effective protections for our waterways. The current proposal leaves the public out of the loop and polluters in the driver&acirc;&euro;&trade;s seat, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s time for DEQ to take the wheel.

If DEQ considers other pollutants safe for trading, they should all be outlined clearly in the rules. Finally the rules do not give confidence that DEQ is able to clearly articulate what it considers acceptable in water quality trades by leaving all planning and assessment of how water quality would be benefited, how credit ratios are determined, and what methods are acceptable for monitoring success to the polluter. DEQ should heavily revise the proposed rules ??? or go back to the drawing board entirely ??? to provide real certainty of expectations for polluters, and more detailed and effective protections for our waterways. The current proposal leaves the public out of the loop and polluters in the driver???s seat, it???s time for DEQ to take the wheel. Sincerely, Harry L.

Our agency has a 15,000 acre natural lands portfolio largely created using dedicated conservation funding. We routinely collaborate with many other organizations in a region with a high demand for both mitigation and creative solutions to challenging environmental and economic issues. We are acutely aware of the need for and benefits of partnership. However, we also strongly believe that transparent accounting and the principle of additionality are important components in earning and maintaining the public???s trust regarding both mitigation and dedicating funds for conservation actions. We believe that a solution exists that honors mitigators with good intentions, allowing them to leverage their investment for the public good, but does not result in de facto subsidies for development with limited dedicated conservation funding. If we can be of assistance in finding creative solutions, please do not hesitate to contact our Parks and Nature Director, Kathleen Brennan-Hunter.

| 1443183437  | John                      | MacDiarmid                  | jmacd@jeffnet.org                   |                                               | Oregon | Water Quality Trading should not allow degradation of the State's waters with a negative impact on beneficial uses. Specifically in a stream, any trade benefit should be in place upstream of the waste load for which the trade is made. For example the Medford WWTP is implementing a shading project to cool the receiving water, the Rogue River, in exchange for the thermal load in the discharge. This would be acceptable if the river were cooled before the thermal load is added to the stream. Such is not the case. It will take up to 60 miles of river downstream of of the discharge to find sufficient unshaded South Bank to improve and offset the WWTP thermal load. Water quality and beneficial uses will be sacrificed for 60 miles to accomplish this trade. This is tantamount to a 60 mile mixing zone! Each fall there are thousands of spawning Chinook Salmon in the upper portion of this 60 mile stretch starting at the High Banks Riffle just below the WWTP discharge. The salmon eggs in those redds need cool water to develop properly, they are compromised with this "trading."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                  |
