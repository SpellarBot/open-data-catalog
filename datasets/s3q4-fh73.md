| Education | Access           | The ability to get a great education and hopefully go on to a trade school or college. To know that life holds more of a future than a lot of kids currently feel they have the ability to attain. I think the biggest problem today are parents. I think there are too many men who are not participating in their children's lives, too many young kids are having babies, and then are too young to engage with their children in the education process. | Web                          |               |
