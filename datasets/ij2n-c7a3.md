Greenhouse gas models are defective. If the cars are used only in a sealed glass jar then it might make sense otherwise it is proving to be complete anti-science and yet another act of environmentalist totalitarianism, narcissism and folly. Top all of that off with the manufacturer's listing of standard emissions and the phase out of old vehicles over time and the whole DEQ emissions program is an anachronism as a taxing experience that serves virtually no purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                        |

I support these proposed standards. I support lowering emissions from vehicles. We need to do this because of public health issues. We need to do this because of climate change issues. These standards include LEV III rules that ensure greenhouse gas reductions from new vehicles will be achieved in Oregon and ZEV 2.0 rules that require pollution-free vehicles to make up an increasing percentage of new vehicle sales. Adopting this proposal will keep Oregon???s rules identical to California???s rules which the Clean Air Act requires of states implementing California???s vehicle emission standards. This is a great proposal. We in Oregon care about these issues, we care about public health. Keep up the good work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                        |

| 1379426000  | Wade       | McLaren   | wmclaren@bluebirdtransfer.com | Blue Bird Moving and Storage   | Washington | We operate in all states and have seen many trucking firms go out of business or quit hauling tonnage into CA due to the strict rules which cause higher operating costs for small and large trucking firms alike. The burden is greater on the small operations like mine. if these rules are implemented, it will cost too much for us to remain in the trucking business.....after 86 years that is a shame. I say NO don't follow the strict rules that cause such a high cost to trucking firms in the NW.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                        |

In fact experts in Oregon have recommended abolishing the DEQ due to the New Car emissions that eliminate the need for testing. 1st We do not have the problems in pollution that California does and 2nd we certainly don't have the Population! But I think more importantly, the cost of doing this is a boondoggle that is unneeded, especially with the economy what it is. CALIFORNIA IS BANKRUPT !!
