The company is closing, the workers are making a statement that before it does so, they should receive severance pay and vacation pay for their hard work over many years. I agree. BOA received $25 billion of taxpayer money with the bailout. They do have an obligation to these workers. How they respond to this call will determine whether I keep my assets in their bank.

I know API integration can be a bit tricky. Have you had Elexio step in and try and get it set up to meet your needs better? They are one of our site sponsors, and great folks to work with. I?m wondering if you?re also using their Fusion database product and how that is working for you. If FaithConnector is working really well for your website, I would perhaps look at a check in solution that works better for you rather than shifting your church website (huge undertaking, I?m sure you know.) Would it help you if I wrote up a children?s check in software round up list with all the vendors available to churches? Sincerely, Lauren bracelet or jaune faux http://www.bestcalove.net/fr/ | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                  |
