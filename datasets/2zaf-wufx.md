In recent years I have developed asthma & I can't help but wonder if moving back into SE, near Johnson Creek & Precision Cast parts has something to do with my half lung capacity.I understand that PCP might provide local jobs but at the cost of what? Stricter regulations on air pollutants is a no brainer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                                   | 
| 1408633777  | John       | Hayes     | jhayes@pacificu.edu                | Forest Grove School Board       | Oregon                | I wish to present written testimony, below, on the revision to DEQ???s air quality rules, specifically as applied to semiconductor manufacturing permits. I am Chair of the Forest Grove School District Board and am writing this in the interest of protecting children???s health. In the November 4, 2013, letter from Thomas R. Wood, Stoel Rives attorney for Intel, to David Monro of Oregon DEQ, Attorney Wood stated on pages 7 & 8: ???Intel is willing to go beyond what is required by the Department???s regulations in order to assure its neighbors that the company is not making the air unsafe to breathe. If better informing the community what is in its air involves extensive additional testing and undergoing additional permitting, the company is willing to do that. ??? Intel anticipates requesting that the Department incorporate the ongoing commitments made to the community into the final Title V permit. Intel is also committing to submit a PSD application covering, at a minimum, its fluoride and GHG emissions. While we do not believe Intel has triggered PSD to date, Intel wants to address the D1X expansion in the most public way possible to ensure that the community has independent verification that Intel is employing Best Available Control Technology (???BACT???) for fluorides and GHGs.??? The key points in Attorney Wood???s paragraph quoted above are these: ??? Intel is willing to go beyond DEQ regulations ??? Intel is willing to undergo additional testing and permitting beyond requirements ??? Intel has committed to submitting a PSD application covering fluoride and GHG emissions ??? Intel wants to ensure that the community has independent verification that it is employing Best Available Control Technology I believe that, in the interest of protecting children???s health, it is important for Oregon DEQ to adopt rules that Intel (and any other producer of semiconductors or related materials) has agreed to that would employ Best Available Control Technology for fluoride and other toxic emissions. Specifically, please retain Oregon's current regulations and add to Section (66) "Federal Major Source," part (e), source categories: (66) (e) (CC) Manufacturing - semiconductor and related devices; Thank you.

Many of these chemicals combine in the atmosphere to actually create a very hazardous "stew" You know the statistics for asthma and autism... please lower the allowable levels of "neurotoxins" in our air. Please take into consideration the cumulative affects of concentrations in neighborhoods and the "spike phenomenon" where total releases remain within limits, but concentrated bursts create poor air quality We must do this for our children.
