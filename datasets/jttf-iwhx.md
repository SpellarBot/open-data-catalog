## Description

Austin Energy set a goal that 35% of energy delivered to customers will come from renewable resources by 2020. Download type, capacity, term, and more for each of Austin Energyâ€™s agreements to purchase power generated by wind, solar, and biomass.

Austin Energy has approximately 850 megawatts of wind power through purchase power agreements with terms ranging from 10 to 25 years, and one short-term agreement. Austin Energy set a goal that 35% of energy delivered to customers will come from renewable resources by 2020. In January 2013, two new wind contracts went online adding an additional 293.9 megawatts of wind power.  Additionally, Austin Energy is purchasing energy produced from the 30 megawatt Webberville Solar Project and a 100 megawatt biomass plant which went online in June 2012. Purchase power agreements for wind, solar and biomass power will bring our renewable portfolio to 23% by the end of 2013. In June 2013 the Austin City Council approved three new wind contracts totaling 570 megawatts which will put the utility four years ahead of schedule for meeting its 35% renewable energy resources goal by 2020. 

Specific information related to purchase power agreements, such as pricing information, is confidential and excepted from disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act.
