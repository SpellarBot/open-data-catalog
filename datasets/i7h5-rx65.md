Provides options for various end user computing devices to connect and run agency applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2014-07-01T00:00:00 | 2018-12-31T00:00:00      | 6000000      | Implementation      | Green          | 0                          |

The project requires three main steps, all of which are closely linked to ensure efficient use of the technologies available with little or no additional cost impact to the state. The first step involves obtaining free scan drivers and installing them on the DOC network to facilitate one-to-one scanning on currently leased MFP?s (Multi Function Printers). The second task requires MIS to establish a protocol for scan to e-mail or scan to private and/or network folders on the network. This task will require the use of a separate server. The last component is the installation of REWRITE software ($500 total agency cost) on the network which will provide the tools necessary to perform document searches and file conversions (i.e.: pdf to word or excel). This project is important because it will allow the agency to use existing technologies to meet daily objectives and comply with directives and legal mandates with increased efficiency. It also eliminates the unnecessary costs of purchasing and maintaining standalone equipment and reduces the overall ?paper? footprint of the agency. It is anticipated that this project will have a minimum negative fiscal impact on the agency and will result in significant savings in both human and natural resources. | 2014-06-02T00:00:00 | 2016-01-01T00:00:00      | 10000        | Post Implementation | Green          | 0                          |

The blackberry server is going away with the migration to Exchange 2013. As a result all blackberries must be replaced with an android or iPhone device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2014-11-04T00:00:00 | 2015-01-16T00:00:00      | 35000        | Post Implementation | Green          | 0                          |
