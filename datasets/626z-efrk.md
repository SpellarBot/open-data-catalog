## Description

This dataset includes pertinent information relating to a capital project?s status administered by the Department of Transportation and the Department of General Services. The current phases for the projects will be updated quarterly and the list of projects will be updated annually when the County Council approves capital projects in May.  Supplemental or projects added during the year will be added as they are approved by the County Council.

Update Frequency:  Quarterly

| 2015        | P509337    | Facility Planning-Transportation (P509337)          | This project provides for planning and preliminary engineering design for new and reconstructed highway projects, pedestrian facilities, bike facilities, and mass transit projects under consideration for inclusion in the Capital Improvements Program (CIP). Prior to the establishment of a stand-alone project in the CIP, the Department of Transportation will perform Phase I of facility planning, a rigorous planning-level investigation of the following critical project elements: purpose and need; usage forecasts; traffic operational analysis; community, economic, social, environmental, and historic impact analyses; recommended concept design and public participation are considered. At the end of Phase I, the Transportation, Infrastructure, Energy and Environment (T&E) Committee of the County Council reviews the work and determines if the project has the merits to advance to Phase II of facility planning: preliminary (35 percent level of completion) engineering design. In preliminary engineering design, construction plans are developed showing specific and detailed features of the project, from which its impacts and costs can be more accurately assessed. At the completion of Phase II, the County Executive and County Council hold project-specific public hearings to determine if the candidate project merits consideration in the CIP as a funded stand-alone project. |                      | Planning           | 1                  | http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/dot-dte/projects/oak/index.html        | 39.275335  | -77.214591  | District 2        |

| 2016        | P720905    | Plum Gar Neighborhood Recreation Center (P720905)   | This project will encompass renovation, space reconfiguration, and an expansion replacing three modular units, to include the construction of an addition including an expanded lobby and administrative area, social hall, kitchen, weight/exercise room, additional toilets, and site improvements including parking. A key component of the site and building infrastructure renovation is to upgrade the facility to conform to the Montgomery County Manual for Planning, Design, and Construction of Sustainable Buildings, including meeting green building/sustainability goals; Montgomery County Energy Design Guidelines; and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The project will be designed to comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines for eventual certification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 19561 Scenery Drive  | Completed          | 1                  | http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DGS-BDC/UMC/720905.html                | 39.1764308 | -77.2342051 | 2                 |

| 2016        | P720918    | Good Hope Neighborhood Recreation Center (P720918)  | The Good Hope Neighborhood Recreation Center, located at 14715 Good Hope Road in Silver Spring, requires demolition of existing building and new construction, to include the construction of a gymnasium, exercise/weight room, activity room, game room, toilets, and storage. A key constraint is the limit on impervious site area, due to the Paint Branch Special Protection Area, resulting in expansion requirements that do not increase the building footprint. A key component of the site and building infrastructure renovation is to upgrade the facility to conform to the Montgomery County manual for planning, design, and construction of sustainable buildings, including meeting green building/sustainability goals; Montgomery County Energy Design Guidelines; and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The project will be designed to comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) guidelines for LEED Silver certification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 14715 Good Hope Road | Preliminary Design | 1                  | http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DGS-BDC/EMC/720918.html                | 39.096171  | -76.984976  | 5                 |
