I work in a studio that is owned by a sole proprietor who provides classes, open studio time, equipment and that produces architectural glass pieces for sale to retailers across the U.S.

I have been interested in glass for many years, but it took a health scare experience for me to really begin creating with glass. I ground myself with focus on the color, the feel and the activity. It is a wonderful stress reducer and an opportunity to help by giving gifts of glass to support others during their difficult times. If the studio that I work in is unable to survive, I and many others will have no place to work.

I live in SE Portland, OR where Bullseye has been under scrutiny for emitting heavy metals from their exhaust stacks during glass production. In an industrial area where there is an intermodal train yard and diesel truck exhaust, a cement company and many other industries tucked in between neighborhoods, we would expect to see  these metals. Uroboros, another Portland-based glass producer is in an industrial area between two freeways that carry a high load of truck traffic, is close to train tracks and a switching yard. Did you know that diesel exhaust produces chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel and many more chemicals that are dangerous to our health?

The Governor of Oregon issued a Cease &amp; Desist order twice to Bullseye without specifically identifying the source of emission. DEQ, Oregon Health Authority, EPA and our elected officials across the country seem to be pointing to the production at Bullseye as the definitive culprit. Fused art glass is limited in production in the US to 6 small manufacturers. Many are in industrial areas where they belong. However, this does make it challenging to identify the real sources of toxins to more accurately deal with the air quality issue.

We all want cleaner air. We all want a thriving economy and jobs. While Bullseye employs about 125 people, many thousands of people depend on their success worldwide to support their families and to pay taxes. They export about 35% of their production. They are a strong contributor to our community both in special projects and income. Bullseye attracts tourism revenue in many of our service sectors due to classes, tours and retail sales of products. 

Bullseye is at present adding baghouses to their furnaces that will allow them to produce glass with 99.9% filtration rate. It is difficult to meet the deadlines for installation when nearly 80% of production had been shut down for a period of time, and at present are strictly limited, with limited impact on air quality.

As recent air monitoring data has shown, there has been little change in air quality since Bullseye has been limited in their production. That points to a stronger likelihood of other bigger contributors in the neighborhood. Please use objective scientific methods and data and consult with glass professionals for advice in making sound decisions when developing pollution control solutions for the glass art industry. Please be fair in application of rules to art glass manufacturers. Please consider the impact on jobs, tax revenues, and the limited win on pollution control when applying subjective and stringent rules on the glass industry with short notification in relationship to the environments they operate in. This effort has a huge financial impact and may well cause production to shift overseas. Sending production to China will not clean our air. It will not support the Oregonians who work in the art glass industry, nor any of those across our continent and the rest of the world. It will not provide any tax revenues. 

Thank you for your time. Please consider using scientific data to have a real impact on our health and air quality, on art and our economy as changes are made in environmental regulations.

Sincerely,
Melody Roth" t:email_address=mroth97@msn.com m:row_number.54i7-gnrh=2

series e:54i7-gnrh d:2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z t:first_name=Susan t:organization="Mind and Soul Art" t:state=Washington t:last_name=Zarit t:comment="Mr. Westersund,

You had asked for people to comment about the fiscal impact of the permanent ruling on the glass industry. However, it has come to my attention that, perhaps, you may be disregarding those of us that are outside the State of Oregon. I do hope I am misinformed. As I had stated in my previous comment, Bullseye Glass Co. is not an island unto itself. It is an integral part of a much larger community...a community of thousands of people to be somewhat exact. Therefore, the decisions you, the DEQ and the EPA, make have a very far reaching effect. Therefore, Mr. Westersund, statements from people outside of Oregon are just as valid as those from within because Oregon is not an island unto itself either.

Now, having said all of that, I am the owner of Mind and Soul Art. I do not make money as I donate my art work to various charities for auctions and other fundraisers. Actually, I helped Eugene's Relay for Life. They have been the largest fundraiser's for that organization. Did you know that? I also help organizations within my own State of Washington: Mosaic, The Answer for Youth, My choices, local animal shelters, etc. I help nation/international organizations: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Walk in My Shoes, American Cancer Society, Autism Speaks, etc. My point in listing some these organizations is to point out that the financial impact is not only about making a living, supporting a family, supporting employees. It is all of those and more.

If you would like some examples of how &quot;out-of-Staters&quot; have a more direct fiscal impact in this matter, please allow me to give you a few examples. I was just recently in Portland for a 5-day education class at Bullseye. Now, I came down a day early, so that's 6 days at a hotel. I stayed at the Oxford Inn &amp; Suites at Jantzen Beach because I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there from the last time I was in town for a Bullseye education class. While in town, I had to purchase food. I also needed to purchase other items I forgot to pack. like a good pair of sturdy shoes. Now, my family joined me during my stay. While I was in class, they were out sightseeing and spending tourism dollars. Now, I was not the only &quot;out-of-Stater&quot; at this class. Bullseye has a large selection of education classes. This draws in many people who spend money in your State.

Please consider all sides of this discussion when making your decision. We all want clean air. I don't want to see what happened to Spectrum Glass (Woodinville,WA) happen to Bullseye or any other glass company." t:email_address=slzarit@msn.com m:row_number.54i7-gnrh=3

Is this rule subject to another rule that regulates visible emissions from the furnaces?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [null, null, null, null] | 
| Melody     | Roth      | mroth97@msn.com         |                            | OR            | I am a full-time health professional and part-time glass artist from Portland, OR. I work in a studio that is owned by a sole proprietor who provides classes, open studio time, equipment and that produces architectural glass pieces for sale to retailers across the U.S. I have been interested in glass for many years, but it took a health scare experience for me to really begin creating with glass. I ground myself with focus on the color, the feel and the activity. It is a wonderful stress reducer and an opportunity to help by giving gifts of glass to support others during their difficult times. If the studio that I work in is unable to survive, I and many others will have no place to work. I live in SE Portland, OR where Bullseye has been under scrutiny for emitting heavy metals from their exhaust stacks during glass production. In an industrial area where there is an intermodal train yard and diesel truck exhaust, a cement company and many other industries tucked in between neighborhoods, we would expect to see these metals. Uroboros, another Portland-based glass producer is in an industrial area between two freeways that carry a high load of truck traffic, is close to train tracks and a switching yard. Did you know that diesel exhaust produces chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel and many more chemicals that are dangerous to our health? The Governor of Oregon issued a Cease & Desist order twice to Bullseye without specifically identifying the source of emission. DEQ, Oregon Health Authority, EPA and our elected officials across the country seem to be pointing to the production at Bullseye as the definitive culprit. Fused art glass is limited in production in the US to 6 small manufacturers. Many are in industrial areas where they belong. However, this does make it challenging to identify the real sources of toxins to more accurately deal with the air quality issue. We all want cleaner air. We all want a thriving economy and jobs. While Bullseye employs about 125 people, many thousands of people depend on their success worldwide to support their families and to pay taxes. They export about 35% of their production. They are a strong contributor to our community both in special projects and income. Bullseye attracts tourism revenue in many of our service sectors due to classes, tours and retail sales of products. Bullseye is at present adding baghouses to their furnaces that will allow them to produce glass with 99.9% filtration rate. It is difficult to meet the deadlines for installation when nearly 80% of production had been shut down for a period of time, and at present are strictly limited, with limited impact on air quality. As recent air monitoring data has shown, there has been little change in air quality since Bullseye has been limited in their production. That points to a stronger likelihood of other bigger contributors in the neighborhood. Please use objective scientific methods and data and consult with glass professionals for advice in making sound decisions when developing pollution control solutions for the glass art industry. Please be fair in application of rules to art glass manufacturers. Please consider the impact on jobs, tax revenues, and the limited win on pollution control when applying subjective and stringent rules on the glass industry with short notification in relationship to the environments they operate in. This effort has a huge financial impact and may well cause production to shift overseas. Sending production to China will not clean our air. It will not support the Oregonians who work in the art glass industry, nor any of those across our continent and the rest of the world. It will not provide any tax revenues. Thank you for your time. Please consider using scientific data to have a real impact on our health and air quality, on art and our economy as changes are made in environmental regulations. Sincerely, Melody Roth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [null, null, null, null] | 
| Susan      | Zarit     | slzarit@msn.com         | Mind and Soul Art          | Washington    | Mr. Westersund, You had asked for people to comment about the fiscal impact of the permanent ruling on the glass industry. However, it has come to my attention that, perhaps, you may be disregarding those of us that are outside the State of Oregon. I do hope I am misinformed. As I had stated in my previous comment, Bullseye Glass Co. is not an island unto itself. It is an integral part of a much larger community...a community of thousands of people to be somewhat exact. Therefore, the decisions you, the DEQ and the EPA, make have a very far reaching effect. Therefore, Mr. Westersund, statements from people outside of Oregon are just as valid as those from within because Oregon is not an island unto itself either. Now, having said all of that, I am the owner of Mind and Soul Art. I do not make money as I donate my art work to various charities for auctions and other fundraisers. Actually, I helped Eugene's Relay for Life. They have been the largest fundraiser's for that organization. Did you know that? I also help organizations within my own State of Washington: Mosaic, The Answer for Youth, My choices, local animal shelters, etc. I help nation/international organizations: American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Walk in My Shoes, American Cancer Society, Autism Speaks, etc. My point in listing some these organizations is to point out that the financial impact is not only about making a living, supporting a family, supporting employees. It is all of those and more. If you would like some examples of how "out-of-Staters" have a more direct fiscal impact in this matter, please allow me to give you a few examples. I was just recently in Portland for a 5-day education class at Bullseye. Now, I came down a day early, so that's 6 days at a hotel. I stayed at the Oxford Inn & Suites at Jantzen Beach because I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there from the last time I was in town for a Bullseye education class. While in town, I had to purchase food. I also needed to purchase other items I forgot to pack. like a good pair of sturdy shoes. Now, my family joined me during my stay. While I was in class, they were out sightseeing and spending tourism dollars. Now, I was not the only "out-of-Stater" at this class. Bullseye has a large selection of education classes. This draws in many people who spend money in your State. Please consider all sides of this discussion when making your decision. We all want clean air. I don't want to see what happened to Spectrum Glass (Woodinville,WA) happen to Bullseye or any other glass company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [null, null, null, null] | 
| Leora      | Druckman  | leorad@aol.com          | na                         | Michigan      | *Why closing Bullseye could mean the death of an international industry.* I make glass art, not for a living, but simply because I love it. But, I respect the many tens of thousands of people around the globe who depend on art glass for their living. This includes talented artists who make beautiful works of art by cutting, melting, shaping, casting and blowing this amazing material. It includes the galleries that sell these works of art; the many wholesale and retail businesses that sell glass tools and materials; the instructors who make their living teaching this ancient craft; the manufacturers of kilns, glass tools, enamels and other additives; and, of course, those who make art glass - the specialty glass required for almost all of today's modern glass crafts. Bullseye is, by far, the primary producer of art glass in the world. Without Bullseye, the art glass industry may cease to exist. But how can a single producer in an industry this large have such a huge impact? Aren't there other colored glass producers in the world? Yes, other companies produce colored glass, but only a few produce colored glass that can actually be used in creating art glass. There are a few producers of colored glass who make glass primarily used to create stained glass, but the glass they make can not be used when creating blown, kiln melted, lampworked or cast glass art. All of which combine multiple colors of glass under high heat and constitute the vast majority of glass art today. There are only a few companies that make glass that can be used in this way. The largest and most experienced is Bullseye. Bullseye is the only major producer of a full color range of 90 COE (coefficient of expansion) glass. Most glass artists use either 90 COE or 96 COE glass. In fact, many restrict their studios to one or the other. Why? While two pieces of colored art glass may look exactly alike, when pieces of COE 90 and COE 96 are combined though heat, hours or even months of work can be destroyed. Glasses with different COEs pull away from each other in heat, causing cracks, warping, breaking and often, one big mess. Bullseye created and perfected the manufacturing processes and technology for producing glass that is COE compatible across an entire product line. Before Bullseye did this, most of the magnificent glass art you see today would not have been possible. Because of their vast selection, rigorous 90 COE testing, high quality and excellent (and very generous) production of educational materials, most in the art glass business primarily stock and use Bullseye glass. The only other major competition comes from producers of COE 96 colored art glass. COE 96 glass is produced almost exclusively by two businesses, Spectrum glass (which just announced that they are going out of business) and Uroboros. The 90 COE and 96 COE glass manufacturers have provided healthy competition with each other in an industry with few competitors. The majority of the rest of the glass produced in the world is of uncertain and/or inconsistent COE and therefore unusable for making most art glass. Usually, businesses do not rely primarily on one supplier for their business needs. Because of the difficulty of producing quality, COE compatible glass, the art glass industry is different. Bullseye is the only major producer of COE 90 compatible glass. Even if everyone in the art glass business attempted to switch to COE 96 glass, many businesses would go under due to the cost of switching all their glass and supporting materials. The art glass industry (like many businesses) is still recovering from the recent recession. Also, due to the death of Spectrum, it is unlikely that enough COE 96 glass in the needed range of colors will be available as soon as it would be needed. And, if Uroboros receives the same treatment as Bullseye, it may end up out of business like its sister Spectrum. Please consider this unique and valuable international industry when making decisions involving Bullseye. Clearly, the company is showing a willingness to improve their impact on the environment as they have already started implementing filtering systems and have offered a plan for reduced emissions. Consider giving time for the company to adjust so it can continue to survive while making these important decisions. And, be very, very sure that the data you are using to make these decisions is accurate and actually leads to any conclusions you decide to make before you destroy a entire industry. | [null, null, null, null] |

We do not want to lose MORE glass manufacturing to China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [null, null, null, null] | 
| Bobbi      | Lolby     | Bobb1e@aol.com          |                            | Montana       | I have been using stained glass and fusing glass now for 40 years. The joy I personly get from a finished item is so satisfying. Yes I believe we need to save our planet but make the goals of better filters or reducing what goes into the air liveable for the manufactures. They can complie but in what time frame? Putting people out of work does no good. From the plants that produce the glass right down to the little guy artists. I am retired and when possible I buy beautiful colored glass. And the products from China do not compare to what is made here in the USA. Please make sure this manufacturing if colored glass remains here in the USA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [null, null, null, null] |

I would appreciate it if you would find a way to help control the pollution rather than shutting factories down. The loss of a USA manufacturer would probably cause the price of glass to rise forcing hobbiest out of their hobby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [null, null, null, null] | 
| MM         | Walter    | mm.newleaf@gmail.com    | from Ella Ross             | GA            | Good afternoon, I am writing to let you know how important my ability to obtain the beautiful glass of Bullseye is to my business. I have a small but nice fused glass business in Atlanta, GA. I do not know how my business can continue if the glass Bullseye produces is discontinued. I do believe we should not taint the air we breathe and sincerely hope all the parties involved will seek a reasonable and mutually beneficial solution so that I can continue in my business.
