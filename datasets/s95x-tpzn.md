A far more comprehensive study on the far-reaching effects on the environment and health effects on people in Oregon. The true (and unaccounted) costs of degradation of the world's environment need to be taken into account. If they want to build this, an escrow account should be set up to deal with all the potential consequences that could result from the damage that this could produce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | m3pk-wcbd    | [null, null, null, null] |

Project developer Ambre Energy has demonstrated a commitment to protecting Oregon?s air and water quality and fish and wildlife habitat at every stage of the proposed project. We?ve reviewed the Morrow Pacific project proposal and designs and are confident that the proven processes used to store and transfer coal at the Port of Morrow will go beyond standard practices to eliminate dust and spillage. For example, railcars will be unloaded in a completely enclosed storage facility. No coal will be visible from outside the facility, which looks similar to grain or food-processing facilities found today in Morrow County. And enclosed conveyors will transfer the coal to covered barges, built specifically for this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |              | [null, null, null, null] |

The air is a lot cleaner here now than it was in 1952 when I moved here as an eleven year old. How about some balance. Respectfully, Roger C.

The particulate and CO2 emissions from the burning of the coal will have very real and direct negative impacts on the air, water, soil and biosphere of Oregon. Additionally these emissions would do much to set back all of the progress Oregon's citizens have made in reducing our states own GHG emissions. Lastly I don't feel that the parties involved are negotiating in good faith regarding steps to mitigate the impact of coal dust on the state's water and air. Once the terminal is built the operators will have a financial incentive to ignore public and environmental safety regardless of the fines that state regulators may levy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | m3pk-wcbd    | [null, null, null, null] |
