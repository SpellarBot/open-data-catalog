| ARTS      | Baseline Changes           | Citywide Adjustments for Standard Cost Changes                         | Citywide technical adjustments made in the initial planning phase reflect changes in the internal services costs (excluding Seattle IT), health care, retirement contribution rate, and updates to unemployment and industrial insurance charges. These adjustments reflect initial assumptions about these costs and inflators early in the budget process. Additionally, this adjustment includes various wage adjustments for labor related costs, including the Annual Wage Increases (AWI) from 2015 through 2018 and a one-time 2015 3.5% Recruitment and Retention wage increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 329197                | 0.00               | 307128                | 0.00               | 2762          | 
| ARTS      | Proposed Changes           | Create the Equitable Development Initiative Cultural Preservation Fund | As the City of Seattle moves to implement its Equitable Development Initiative, Arts will establish a Cultural Preservation Fund in partnership with the Office of Planning and Community Development (OPCD) to support organizations that are vulnerable to displacement while also engaging them in the development of equitable development strategies across the City. In 2018, the fund will increase from $150,000 to $200,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 150000                | 0.00               | 200000                | 0.00               | 2935          | 
| ARTS      | Proposed Changes           | Increase Funding for the Cultural Facilities Fund                      | As the economy has improved, a growing number of arts organizations have asked for financial support for capital projects. This change will bring Cultural Facilities grant funding into alignment with demand for investment in arts spaces by adding $767,000 for capital facilities grants in 2018, bringing the total amount of 2018 funding to more than $1 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 0                     | 0.00               | 767000                | 0.00               | 2954          | 
| ARTS      | Proposed Changes           | Increase Capital Funding to Partner Organizations                      | This item adds funding in 2017 to support the construction and renovation of cultural facilities at the Nordic Heritage Museum ($350,000), Burke Museum ($350,000), Town Hall Seattle ($350,000) and Hugo House ($250,000).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1300000               | 0.00               | 0                     | 0.00               | 3088          | 
| ARTS      | Proposed Changes           | Restore Funding to Core Grant Funding Programs                         | This change increases funding to core programs funded through the Arts Account in the Cultural Partnerships program. The grant programs - Civic Partners, Youth Arts, CityArtist, smART Ventures and Neighborhood and Community Arts - give one-time funding to local artists, arts and cultural organizations and arts-education programs. This change restores core programs to pre-recession levels. It will also allow Arts to potentially increase funding to historically underfunded programs without having to significantly cut funding to existing programs. This adds $200,000 in 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 0                     | 0.00               | 200000                | 0.00               | 2955          | 
| ARTS      | Proposed Changes           | Expand Creative Advantage Program                                      | The Creative Advantage initiative addresses inequity in arts education while transforming how Seattle youth learn. This item expands Arts' education partnership with Seattle Public Schools (SPS) into Career and Technical Education. Arts will work with SPS to develop a Skill Center focused on Media Arts located on the Seattle Center Campus. Funding supports the initial resource and equipment needs of the program ($50,000) and co-funds a position within SPS to oversee the program at the District level ($50,000). The Skill Center will be available to juniors and seniors during the school year and open to all high school students in the summer. In 2018, the amount decreases to $50,000 because student enrollment at the Skill Center will pay for ongoing costs of the program. Arts will continue to support the position within SPS.                                                                                                                                                                                          | 100000                | 0.00               | 50000                 | 0.00               | 2938          | 
| ARTS      | Proposed Changes           | Support Creative Industries Position in the Office of Film and Music   | The Office of Arts & Culture (Arts) will provide salary support for a Creative Industries Business Advocate position in the Office of Film + Music + Special Events (OFMSE) to support the development of Seattle's creative economy. The creative economy is comprised of creative industries including film, music, visual arts, virtual reality, gaming and additional media sectors. This position will serve as the project lead for creative industry strategy planning and implementation (building off of the report being funded by Arts in 2016 and 2017), and will create and implement a strategy aligned with the goals of Arts, OFMSE, and the Office of Economic Development (OED). The position will also continue to work with the Arts Commission and Music Commission's Youth and Community Committee, with increased focus on alignment with Creative Advantage, Music and Career Day, internships and workforce development. Finally, the position will continue supporting the work of the Music Commission and other OFM priorities. | 127000                | 0.00               | 130810                | 0.00               | 2934          |
