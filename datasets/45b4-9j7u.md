## Description

NNDSS - Table I. infrequently reported notifiable diseases - 2017.  In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.  

Note:
These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. 

Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. 

Footnote:
?: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA: Not available. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. 

* Case counts for reporting years 2016 and 2017 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2012 through 2015 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. 

? This table does not include cases from the U.S. territories. Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. 

? Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.

? Updated weekly reports from the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II. 

** Not reportable in all jurisdictions. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table, except for the arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatric mortality. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html.

?? Data for Haemophilus influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.

?? In 2016, the nationally notifiable condition ?Hepatitis B Perinatal Infection? was renamed to ?Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection? and reflects updates in the 2016 CSTE position statement for Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection.

?? Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. 

*** Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. 

??? Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II.

??? Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses.  With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2011 have been variant influenza viruses.  Total case counts are provided by the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).

??? Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.

**** Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as "viral hemorrhagic fevers". Beginning in 2015, NNDSS has been updated to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed below. In addition to the four cases of Ebola diagnosed in the United States to date in 2014, six residents of the United States have been medically evacuated to the United States for care after developing Ebola in West Africa. Ten of the 11 VHF cases reported for 2014 are confirmed as Ebola and one as Lassa fever. 

????The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists approved position statement 16-ID-01 in June 2016, which modifies the previous case definition and naming convention from "Zika virus congenital infection" to "Zika virus disease, non-congenital?.

NOTE:  These data may not reflect the case counts submitted by Oregon, Michigan, and Upstate New York due to changes in data processing.
