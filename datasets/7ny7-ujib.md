| U.S. Highway 26 at Glencoe Road Interchange                    | 17059      | The U.S. 26 project at the Glencoe Road Interchange is located in the City of North Plains in Washington County. The project will improve safety and capacity of the interchange.
View an aerial photo of the project area.
The project, as originally developed in the Draft Interchange Area Management Plan several years ago, was estimated to cost $80 to $90 million.
ODOT has worked with the City of North Plains and Washington County to develop a design concept that meets the $32 million budget provided by the JTA. Project elements include:
Replacing the Glencoe Road bridge over U.S. 26 with a new, four-lane bridge, and improving vertical clearance
Lengthening and widening the U.S. 26 westbound exit ramp
Replacing the culvert on Glencoe Road to the north of the interchange with a new structure
Improving pedestrian and bicycle connections on the new bridge over U.S. 26
Improving intersections, including traffic signals, signing, striping, drainage and water quality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The existing two-lane Glencoe Road over-crossing lacks adequate shoulders, turn lanes, and bicycle/ pedestrian accommodations. The most significant safety issue to be addressed is that the existing westbound off-ramp is not long enough to safely accommodate vehicles using the interchange, creating backups onto U.S. 26.
The U.S. 26 Glencoe Road Interchange project will serve the projected increase in traffic volumes, both from the adjacent City of North Plains and the larger regional vicinity, which includes the Cities of Hillsboro, Cornelius, and Forest Grove. The interchange is an important access point from U.S. 26 to these cities and the project will improve the capacity of the system and result in better mobility in the region.
The project will also contribute to economic development by supporting planned land use and industrial development in western Washington County. | This project is complete.

| Interstate 84 at 257th Interchange (Troutdale) Phases 2 and 3  | 17060      | Interstate 84 at the 257th Interchange, located in the City of Troutdale in Multnomah County, is an important freeway connection to many industrial businesses at the eastern end of the Columbia industrial corridor. The project will support connections to this important employment area by improving safety and capacity in the I-84/257th interchange area.
In July 2009, work began to improve the east end of the I-84 Troutdale interchange (Exit 17). The project, which was funded by ODOT, Port of Portland, City of Troutdale and federal stimulus funds, added an additional turn lane for traffic headed east on South Frontage Road to 257th Drive/NW Graham Road (I-84, Exit 17) and was completed in December 2009.
Project elements completed include:
widening and lengthening the I-84 eastbound exit ramp, and improving the intersection;
adding a third lane to South Frontage Road; and
improving the intersection at the I-84 westbound exit ramp and Graham Road, including adding a third lane to a portion of North Frontage Road.
building a new I-84 overpass crossing over Marine Drive
widening Marine Drive to inlcude two-way traffic
Additional project elements will be designed with JTA funding. Construction of these additional project elements will depend on securing other funding, such as the Federal Transportation Reauthorization request for $28 million that ODOT, the Port of Portland and the City of Troutdale are supporting. | The interchange experiences traffic backups on the I-84 eastbound exit ramp during afternoon peak hours. This is a significant safety concern as vehicles are forced to back up into the travel lanes of the interstate. A recent traffic study, specifically addressing the increased traffic generated from the newsly constructed FedEx ground distribution facility, forecasts that congestion in the area will soon worsen. This project will improve safety, reduce congestion and provide capacity for future development of the Port's industrial property north of I-84.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | This project is substantially complete and all new features are open to traffic. When weather allows, the contractor will finish permenent striping, perform work on the ramps to the sidewalks and landscaping.

| State Highway 212: Sunrise Corridor Phase 1, Units 1, 2, and 3 | 17061      | The Clackamas Industrial Area is home to one of the state's busiest and most critical freight distribution centers. Community development and industrial expansion in the Sunrise Corridor are expected to grow significantly and the existing Oregon 212/224 corridor is incapable of handling this increased demand.
Since 1988, the east/west Sunrise Corridor has been identified as an essential connection from I-5 and I-205 to U.S. 26 (Mt. Hood Highway), and to central and eastern Oregon. After years of public involvement, community participation and environmental investigation, on February 23, 2011, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) signed a Record of Decision (ROD) providing the necessary federal clearances for construction of the identified improvements.
The Sunrise Jobs and Transportation Act Project is constructing a smaller phase of the larger Sunrise Corridor Preferred Alternative to address existing congestion and safety problems in the Oregon 212/224 corridor. The Sunrise JTA Project will construct a new road from I-205 at the Milwaukie Expressway to 122nd Avenue and some local roadway connections serving the Lawnfield Industrial District.
ODOT and Clackamas County developed the JTA project proposal in spring 2010 and hosted a public meeting in June 2010 to discuss the proposal, answer questions and take comments. ODOT held the first design open house on November 8, 2011.                            | When complete, the project will reduce congestion, increase safety, and improve economic development opportunities and freight mobility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Construction on this project started in the spring of 2013.
