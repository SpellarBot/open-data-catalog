| 1452162505  | Bourtai Hargrove | Bourtai31@gmail.com     | A cap on carbon emissions is overdue. The rules should reduce carbon emissions at a faster rate. We need zero carbon emissions from these sources by 2035. The trade provisions weaken the rule and should be eliminated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                         | 
| 1452163016  | Joel Carlson     | fox7799@gmail.com       | Washingtonians are fighting very hard to save our state and planet from fossil fuel global warming destruction. Organizations include http://www.sierraclub.org/washington/south-sound-group , http://www.olympiafor.org/Climate_Crisis.html and https://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/gptbf7 . Global warming fossil fuels must stay in the ground so we don't destroy life on earth in our current sixth great mass extinction. Almost all life on earth disappeared in previous mass extinctions. We must very quickly switch to renewable energy including solar. Electric vehicles keep costing less while going farther on a charge so fossil fuel vehicles must be eliminated. Wood construction including large multi-story projects sequesters a lot of carbon. Many trees must be planted. Animal agriculture accounts for a lot of carbon pollution so that must be eliminated. Now is the time for action!

For too long, people have bene adversly affected by pollution leading to climate related disasters and health problems. I have asthma and it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to breathe in one of the cleanest state's in the Union. Thank you for you proposal in cleaning up Washington's air and keep up the good work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document, 7f058af4-e9f2-4bc7-a113-f7af5938bd69, BPB clean air rule.docx, 146171] |
