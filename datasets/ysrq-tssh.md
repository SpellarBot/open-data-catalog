## Description

The Aquatic Plant and Algae Management General Permit (permit) is a combined National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and State Waste Discharge General Permit. It covers the in-water and shoreline (including roadsides and ditch banks) treatment of native and noxious plants and algae. It also covers nutrient inactivation treatments. The permit allows the discharge of a specific list of aquatic labeled herbicides, algaecides, biological water clarifiers, adjuvants, marker dyes, and nutrient inactivation products into the freshwaters of Washington. These are comments received on the draft permit.
