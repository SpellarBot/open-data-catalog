## Description

The Aquatic Plant and Algae Management General Permit (permit) is a combined National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and State Waste Discharge General Permit. It covers the in-water and shoreline (including roadsides and ditch banks) treatment of native and noxious plants and algae. It also covers nutrient inactivation treatments. The permit allows the discharge of a specific list of aquatic labeled herbicides, algaecides, biological water clarifiers, adjuvants, marker dyes, and nutrient inactivation products into the freshwaters of Washington. These are comments received on the draft permit.

series e:ysrq-tssh d:2015-12-07T09:14:42.000Z t:draft_permit_comments="Our first concern is the new requirement that the applicator return to the lake and remove the signed Ecology requires be posted.  This is something that will add between $500 and $1,000 to the cost of completing noxious aquatic weed control for the clients that require these services.  There should be an exception that the sponsor organization or the homeowners we work for can remove these signs.


This permit keeps one of the primary tools we have to fight toxic algae blooms as experimental when it is completely operational world wide.  Phoslock is a technology that was developed 25 years ago by the Australian National Science Academy.  It sequesters phosphorus with a nontoxic technology and that lowers the carrying capacity for a lake or pond to develop toxic algae blooms.  The alternatives that are allowed are Alum buffered with Sodium Aluminate, this blend can be extremely toxic to fish and there have been two major fish kills from the introduction of these technologies to Washington Lakes in the past few years.  This has occurred when the buffer Sodium Aluminate is added to the mix.  This compound is extremely dangerous to handle.  There are over 20 published papers in peer reviewed scientific journals that support the operational use of this technology, it should be considered operational so there are alternatives to the more toxic technologies to turn back phosphorus pollution. 


In the past decades, Sonar aquatic herbicide has been used to effectively eradicate the invasive aquatic weed Eurasian Milfoil using a whole lake treatment scenario.  This practice would effectively be banned by this permit.  The laws in Washington State prohibit actions that would impair the control of noxious aquatic weeds and not having access to this technology where appropriate would impair Eurasian Milfoil Control Efforts.  In addition, there has been one infestation of Hydrilla in Washington State and that infestation was eradicated using whole lake treatment technology.  If Hydrilla returns, and as a Class A noxious weed its eradication is mandated, this permit will limit the ability to attack this plant." t:name="Terry McNabb" m:row_number.ysrq-tssh=3

If the DOE wishes to further regulate chemical treatments on state owned bodies of water, perhaps the DOE should consider providing more funding to property owners to maintain these waters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                             |                             |                               |

This is something that will add between $500 and $1,000 to the cost of completing noxious aquatic weed control for the clients that require these services. There should be an exception that the sponsor organization or the homeowners we work for can remove these signs. This permit keeps one of the primary tools we have to fight toxic algae blooms as experimental when it is completely operational world wide. Phoslock is a technology that was developed 25 years ago by the Australian National Science Academy. It sequesters phosphorus with a nontoxic technology and that lowers the carrying capacity for a lake or pond to develop toxic algae blooms. The alternatives that are allowed are Alum buffered with Sodium Aluminate, this blend can be extremely toxic to fish and there have been two major fish kills from the introduction of these technologies to Washington Lakes in the past few years. This has occurred when the buffer Sodium Aluminate is added to the mix. This compound is extremely dangerous to handle. There are over 20 published papers in peer reviewed scientific journals that support the operational use of this technology, it should be considered operational so there are alternatives to the more toxic technologies to turn back phosphorus pollution. In the past decades, Sonar aquatic herbicide has been used to effectively eradicate the invasive aquatic weed Eurasian Milfoil using a whole lake treatment scenario. This practice would effectively be banned by this permit. The laws in Washington State prohibit actions that would impair the control of noxious aquatic weeds and not having access to this technology where appropriate would impair Eurasian Milfoil Control Efforts. In addition, there has been one infestation of Hydrilla in Washington State and that infestation was eradicated using whole lake treatment technology. If Hydrilla returns, and as a Class A noxious weed its eradication is mandated, this permit will limit the ability to attack this plant. |                                                                                                                                                                             |                             |                               |

The removal of posted application signs should be done by the land owner or sponsoring group, such as a home owners association as the additional cost could limit management of nuisance & noxious aquatic plants due to increased operational costs. 2) Fluridone treatments need to remain a viable option for managers & agencies to use to combat Myriophyllum spicatum. Limiting its use could prove detrimental in terms of stopping the spread of M. spicatum as well as hinder eradication efforts of Hydrilla verticillata. Fluridone is also very effective at managing duckweed (Lemna spp., Spirodella spp.), water meal (Wollfia spp.) & Egeria densa. The main benefit to using Fluridone is that it kills plants slowly, limiting the chances of removing a significant amount of dissolved oxygen from the water column and contributing to a fish kill. As one can still purchase these plants through ornamental plant gardens, their establishment & subsequent management and eradication need to be considered. There are a limited number of effective management tools that systemically attack noxious aquatic vegetation and contribute to long term control, it would severely hinder managers by eliminating the use of Fluridone as it is currently allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                             |                             |                               |

The notices are often reminders that the herbicide application was completed and that their dollars were in fact put to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                             |                             |                               |

The current timing windows are very salmon and steelhead centric and scientific literature is replete with information to modify the current timing windows. For example, current information points to conducting in-water work in the Columbia River once bull trout have migrated to their spawning grounds, but not after they return to the Columbia River. Secondly, there appears to be no consideration for Pacific lamprey timing windows. Depending on the scope and location )of a proposed in-water project in the Columbia River, please consider truncating the timing windows to minimize effects to all applicable life history stages of Pacific lamprey. Lastly, please delineate the process for updating the timing windows in subsequent drafts of the permit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                             |                             |                               |
