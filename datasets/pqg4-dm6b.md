It hears misdemeanor and summons cases and combines punishment with help to deter future offending. It holds low-level offenders accountable by sentencing them to perform community restitution that is immediate, visible, and meaningful. At the same time, it helps offenders address underlying problems, such as homelessness, unemployment, and substance abuse, by linking them to on-site social services such as mental health counseling, job training, and drug treatment. To meet the specific needs of women, we run Choices, a comprehensive initiative that helps women involved with the justice system to achieve their independence and transcend their pasts. | N          |                                  | N     | N                                | Y            | N        | Y                             | N                              | Y                         | N            | N                 | Y         | Y                       | Y      | N            | Y       | Y           | Y              | Y                                       | N                                    | N                        | N                          | Y               |                | N              | N                        | N          | N                                                | N                    | N                 | Y         |          | N                             | Published |
