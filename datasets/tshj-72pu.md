Based on their journal entries, the explorers encountered five different species of fish from the family Salmonidae. They described at least two species of resident trout and four of the six species of Pacific salmon and steelhead during their travels up and down the Columbia and Snake river systems. Fish species encountered and described include the common salmon (chinook), red charr (sockeye), white salmon trout (coho or silver), salmon trout (steelhead), and spotted trout (cutthroat)."
