## Description

Inspections conducted by the Department of Environment (DOE) from April, 1997 to December 31, 2011 and by the Department of Public Health (CDPH) since January 1, 2012. On January 1, 2012, the Department of Environment was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   
Data fields requiring description are detailed below. 
INSPECTION ID:  This is the unique identifier of the inspection. DOE inspection records are prefixed with ?DOEINS.? CDPH inspections are numeric. 
INSPECTION NAME: This is the name of the site that was inspected. This is usually the company/owner name, address, or building name.  
MAPPED LOCATION: Contains the latitude/longitude coordinates of the facility. The latitude/longitude coordinate is determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal?s geocoding process.  
 INSPECTOR: Contains the name of the inspector or engineer who conducted the inspection. 
INSPECTION CATEGORY: Describes the type of inspection performed. Generally, inspection types can be organized into the following categories:
?COMPLAINT RESPONSE? Inspections conducted in response to citizen complaints. See CDPH Environmental Complaints dataset for type of environmental complaints.
