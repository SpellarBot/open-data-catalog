series e:j8eb-8um2 d:2014-11-25T00:00:00.000Z t:content="(Salem, OR) &mdash; Governor Kitzhaber released the following statement:

&quot;The verdict rendered by the Grand Jury in Ferguson, Missouri has sparked anger and frustration across our nation. But it is in these moments of palpable response to years of injustice that I speak to you as a father of a son in America.

All parents, regardless of race, class, culture or origin, should feel the unshakeable confidence that when they send their children into the streets, they will return home safe and sound.

The pain and suffering experienced by Michael Brown's mother ring true for all parents when she said that this is about the loss of a child, a loss that came at the hands of &ldquo;&hellip;people who are paid to protect them.&rdquo; These simple words are not just about black or white. Nor are they about criticizing the police officers who have pledged to protect and serve.

These words are about our collective responsibility to ensure that our children are free from suffering the pain of bullying, of stereotyping, of racial profiling and any other behavior that ends their possibilities before they begin. These words are about making sure law enforcement has the training, skills, tools and support necessary to do their jobs safely&hellip;both for themselves and the communities they are entrusted with protecting.

Most importantly, her words are about creating an expectation that bias against anyone &mdash; regardless of whether it is from institutions or individuals&mdash;will not be tolerated.

Forty-six years ago on April 4, 1968 &ndash; the day that Martin Luther King was assassinated &mdash; Robert Kennedy spoke in Indianapolis, and said:

 &ldquo;What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.&rdquo;

Let us take from the tragedy in Ferguson, Missouri a lesson that we have failed to learn over the past 50 years.  This is also a collective tragedy that should &mdash; and must &ndash; wake us up to the indisputable fact that that we have a long way to go in terms of in addressing the underlying disparities and inequities in our society.

This tragic loss of another son's life, reinforces the fact that many communities are justifiably frustrated and mistrusting of our systems. The people who are marching in Ferguson and across the country are calling for immediate action. This is an opportunity for us to change how we talk about race and inequality in our communities. Now is the chance for us to commit ourselves to ensuring that we are all working toward a system that creates justice for all.&quot;" t:headline="Governor Kitzhaber reflects on Ferguson" t:last_modified_by="Linda Morrell" t:footer_content="{

| Governor's Office |                  | Governor Kitzhaber reflects on Ferguson                                                                 |                                                                                                                        | 2014-11-25T00:00:00 | 2014         | Salem | OR    |                | (Salem, OR) ? Governor Kitzhaber released the following statement: "The verdict rendered by the Grand Jury in Ferguson, Missouri has sparked anger and frustration across our nation. But it is in these moments of palpable response to years of injustice that I speak to you as a father of a son in America. All parents, regardless of race, class, culture or origin, should feel the unshakeable confidence that when they send their children into the streets, they will return home safe and sound. The pain and suffering experienced by Michael Brown's mother ring true for all parents when she said that this is about the loss of a child, a loss that came at the hands of ??people who are paid to protect them.? These simple words are not just about black or white. Nor are they about criticizing the police officers who have pledged to protect and serve. These words are about our collective responsibility to ensure that our children are free from suffering the pain of bullying, of stereotyping, of racial profiling and any other behavior that ends their possibilities before they begin. These words are about making sure law enforcement has the training, skills, tools and support necessary to do their jobs safely?both for themselves and the communities they are entrusted with protecting. Most importantly, her words are about creating an expectation that bias against anyone ? regardless of whether it is from institutions or individuals?will not be tolerated. Forty-six years ago on April 4, 1968 ? the day that Martin Luther King was assassinated ? Robert Kennedy spoke in Indianapolis, and said: ?What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.? Let us take from the tragedy in Ferguson, Missouri a lesson that we have failed to learn over the past 50 years. This is also a collective tragedy that should ? and must ? wake us up to the indisputable fact that that we have a long way to go in terms of in addressing the underlying disparities and inequities in our society. This tragic loss of another son's life, reinforces the fact that many communities are justifiably frustrated and mistrusting of our systems. The people who are marching in Ferguson and across the country are calling for immediate action. This is an opportunity for us to change how we talk about race and inequality in our communities. Now is the chance for us to commit ourselves to ensuring that we are all working toward a system that creates justice for all."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | { "Photos": [], "Videos": [], "Audios": [] }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                 |                      |          |            | Melissa Navas|Press Secretary||Governor's Office|melissa.navas@oregon.gov|503-378-5965 | Chris Pair|Deputy Press Secretary||Governor's Office|chris.pair@oregon.gov|503-378-5040 |          |          |          |             | 2015-01-15T12:00:28 | Linda Morrell     | 2015-01-15T12:00:28 | Linda Morrell    |               |               |               |               |               |          |          |          |          | 
| Governor's Office |                  | Governor Kitzhaber names Iris Bell Executive Director of Youth Development Council                      |                                                                                                                        | 2012-07-09T00:00:00 | 2012         | Salem | OR    |                | (Salem, OR) ?

Governor Kitzhaber today announced new key appointments to senior positions in his administration. Elana Pirtle-Guiney has been appointed Labor and Workforce Advisor; Lauri Aunan will serve as Interim Natural Resource Policy Advisor; and Amy Wojcicki has been named Interim Communications Director. Pirtle-Guiney is a graduate of Lewis & Clark College, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in International Affairs with an emphasis on Environmental Policy. Pirtle-Guiney's career is marked by eight successful years at Oregon AFL-CIO where she most recently served as Legislative and Communications Director. Pirtle-Guiney will serve as the Labor and Workforce Advisor and begin her new position January 6. Aunan earned a Juris Doctor at the University of California, Berkeley, Law School after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts at Florida State University. After serving as an attorney for six years, Aunan held several positions to tackle policy solutions to environmental challenges. Aunan spent nine years at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality where she ultimately served as Water Quality Division Manager. She comes to the Governor's Office from the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, where she was named Grant Program Manager. Aunan will begin working in the Governor's Office December 15. Wojcicki returns to the Governor's Office after serving as Communications Director for the Governor's re-election campaign. She has also worked as Chief of Staff for the Oregon House Majority Office, and as a spokesperson for Governor Kitzhaber for the first three years of his current administration. Her professional background includes more than 10 years working for national and statewide campaigns across the country. An Oregon native, Wojcicki was raised in Clackamas and is proud alum of Oregon State University. Her position is effective immediately. Duke Shepard will continue to serve as Labor and Human Services Advisor until the end of December, and will become Deputy Director at OHSU's Center for Evidence-Based Policy in January 2015. Workforce Advisor Agnes Balassa will serve in her role until the end of January before heading to Washington state to pursue new opportunities. Natural Resource Policy Advisor Brett Brownscombe has been named Interim Deputy Director at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife effective immediately. "It's tough to see Duke, Agnes and Brett leave our office," Governor Kitzhaber said. "We'll miss this talented and dedicated group of colleagues who have made contributions that benefit Oregonians across our state. I look forward to seeing how their careers will continue to help others on their paths to prosperity."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | { "Photos": [], "Videos": [], "Audios": [] }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                 |                      |          |            | Melissa Navas|Press Secretary||Governor's Office|melissa.navas@oregon.gov|503-378-5965 | Chris Pair|Deputy Press Secretary||Governor's Office|chris.pair@oregon.gov|503-378-5040 |          |          |          |             | 2015-01-15T12:04:12 | Linda Morrell     | 2015-01-15T12:04:12 | Linda Morrell    |               |               |               |               |               |          |          |          |          | 
| Governor's Office |                  | Governor Kitzhaber to nominate Lynne Saxton to lead the Oregon Health Authority                         |                                                                                                                        | 2014-12-18T00:00:00 | 2014         | Salem | OR    |                | (Salem, OR) ? Governor Kitzhaber is pleased to announce today he will nominate Lynne Saxton to lead the Oregon Health Authority as its new director. The Governor will submit Saxton's name for Oregon State Senate confirmation during the upcoming legislative session. She will serve as acting director beginning Jan. 20, 2015. Saxton will join the Oregon Health Authority following her post as Executive Director of Youth Villages Oregon, a provider of mental health and social services for children and families. Her successful and distinguished career includes leadership roles at ChristieCare, a children's mental health provider, Portland General Electric, and other positions in the public and private sector. "Lynne is a dynamic leader who has worked in a number of sectors, and proven herself effective in complex environments," Governor Kitzhaber said. "Her success stems from her focus to drive to outcomes. I am pleased to have her lead the agency and continue our success in implementing healthcare transformation. Her experience and vision will ensure OHA continues to support those efforts and I look forward to working with the Oregon Senate on her confirmation." Saxton will lead the Oregon Health Authority, which is charged with improving the lifelong health of Oregonians; increasing the quality, reliability, and availability of care; and lowering or containing costs of care. The Oregon Health Authority includes most of the state's health care programs, including Public Health, Addictions and Mental Health Services, the Oregon Health Plan, Healthy Kids, and employee benefits for public employees and school districts. "Oregonians have a right to quality, affordable health care and it is my mission to make that a reality," Saxton said. "The state has seen measureable health care transformation success with the Governor's leadership, and I am honored to be part of those exciting changes while leading OHA. My commitment is to continue leading the agency and its dedicated team to produce results for all Oregonians. Those we serve deserve nothing less." Among her volunteer work, Saxton serves on the Oregon State Court Juvenile Justice Mental Health Task Force; the Oregon Early Learning Council; and Willamette University's Board of Trustees. She has been recognized with the National Alliance on Mental Illness Oregon's New Freedom Award; the Portland Business Journal's Women of Influence Award; and the Children's Mental Health Advocate of the Year Award by the Oregon Council of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Saxton replaces interim director Suzanne Hoffman who served in the role since May. "I thank Suzanne for her leadership and guidance as she helped the Oregon Health Authority deliver on healthcare transformation and improve the lives of thousands of Oregonians," the Governor said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | { "Photos": [], "Videos": [], "Audios": [] }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Health          |                      |          |            | Melissa Navas|Press Secretary||Governor's Office|melissa.navas@oregon.gov|503-378-5965 | Chris Pair|Deputy Press Secretary||Governor's Office|chris.pair@oregon.gov|503-378-5040 |          |          |          |             | 2014-12-22T07:50:04 | Linda Morrell     | 2015-01-15T12:05:47 | Linda Morrell    | Health        |               |               |               |               |          |          |          |          | 
| Governor's Office |                  | Governor Kitzhaber commends rail car safety commitment from global partners                             | Company announces all tank cars received at Clatskanie facility must meet higher safety standards                      | 2014-04-30T00:00:00 | 2014         | Salem | OR    |                | (Salem, OR) ? After consulting with Governor Kitzhaber on his efforts to improve rail safety in Oregon, Global Partners announced today that beginning June 1, 2014, the company will no longer accept shipments of crude oil in DOT-111 tank cars that do not meet CPC-1232 safety standards. Instead, Global Partners, which owns an ethanol manufacturing and crude oil transloading facility at Port Westward in Clatskanie, will only accept shipments of crude oil in newer CPC-1232 tank rail cars. The Governor applauded the announcement. ?I appreciate the commitment to safety Global Partners is showing to its neighbors in northwest Oregon,? said Governor Kitzhaber. ?Rail operators, shippers, and facility owners have an obligation to take every measure possible to ensure hazardous materials they transport and receive are shipped as safely as possible.? DOT-111 tank cars have been involved in some of the most notable rail accidents in North America over the last year. Starting in June, all crude oil shipments to Global's Clatskanie facility must arrive in the newer CPC-1232 tank cars. The CPC-1232 standards add safety features for leak prevention and puncture resistance. They also include a thicker, more puncture-resistant shell or jacket around rail cars, extra protective head shields at both ends of the tank car, and additional protection for the top fittings. "Global is committed to safety, and as part of that commitment we are requiring that all crude oil shipped by rail to our Clatskanie facility is transported in CPC 1232-compliant cars," said Eric Slifka, Global Partner's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We look forward to continuing our work with the state and local community to strengthen the safe transloading of crude oil and commence ethanol manufacturing to create new clean energy sources and economic opportunities for the region." ?We also need leadership at the federal level to phase out unsafe and outdated tank cars,? said Governor Kitzhaber. The Governor recently spoke with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx requesting that the Administration adopt a new national policy to upgrade safety standards of tank rail cars. The Governor also wrote to Oregon's congressional delegation expressing concerns about how slowly federal agencies have moved to update tank car designs. In the letter, the Governor wrote, the ?National Surface Transportation Board first identified these rail cars on its ?Most Wanted List' in 1991, saying they are ?more susceptible to damage' than other rail cars, and therefore ?pose a substantial danger to life, property, and the environment.'? Global's announcement comes one day after state legislators, local government officials, and congressional staff met with local, state, and federal agencies and railroad companies to discuss rail safety in Oregon. The group gathered in Linnton, Oregon, for a comprehensive look at current programs and resources in place for rail safety and emergency training and response. The briefing was part of Governor Kitzhaber's ongoing efforts to identify where more funding and oversight are needed at the state level, and to identify additional actions to improve rail safety and emergency response efforts.

| Governor's Office |                  | Governor Kitzhaber joins health partners to discuss statewide ebola preparedness                        |                                                                                                                        | 2014-10-28T00:00:00 | 2014         | Salem | OR    |                | (Portland, OR) ? Governor Kitzhaber joined with local and state health officials and partners Monday to discuss Oregon's statewide coordination and preparedness plans to handle Ebola. "Partners across the state, from local health departments and hospitals to health care providers and first responders, are stepping up so that providers and public health professionals have the support, tools and training they need to respond to Ebola should it come to Oregon," said Governor Kitzhaber. "While the risk of Ebola is low, we take preparedness and coordination seriously. My thanks to our hospital system and public health partners for their quick and thorough engagement on this matter." The Governor announced six Oregon health systems have agreed to serve as referral centers for patients who have or are suspected to have Ebola virus: OHSU, Legacy Health, PeaceHealth, Providence Health & Services, Samaritan Health Services, and Kaiser Permanente Northwest. These health systems will accept these patients from other state hospitals, clinics or EMS providers, if no federal facility is available. Earlier in the day, the Governor attended a briefing with representatives from the Oregon Health Authority, Oregon health systems, professional nursing and medical associations, and local and state public health officials to talk about statewide Ebola response and how they would continue to partner with each other.

| Governor's Office |                  | Governor Kitzhaber Announces Awards to Build Affording Housing Across Oregon                            |                                                                                                                        | 2014-11-10T00:00:00 | 2014         | Salem | OR    |                | (Salem, OR) ? Governor Kitzhaber and Oregon Housing and Community Services are pleased to announce the awarding of funds to build or preserve 14 apartment complexes across Oregon, providing critical housing to low-income Oregonians. The State Housing Council on Friday approved grants and tax credits across Oregon ? from St. Helens to Medford, and from Hillsboro to Prineville to LaGrande. "Today, too many Oregonians don't have an affordable place to call home, and they struggle to pay rent and put food on the table," Governor Kitzhaber said. "These projects funded today through Oregon Housing and Community Services will meet critical needs in our communities. Many of the projects make progress toward other state goals, such as support for families recovering from addiction and returning to employment, seniors and people with disabilities receiving the services they need to stay healthy and stable, and families having stable places to raise their children." The State Housing Council approved grants and tax credits for 14 projects and nearly 600 units, which includes new units to be built in the coming year, as well as units which need to be rehabilitated so they can continue to provide a safe and affordable place for people to call home. "We know these homes will make a huge difference for many Oregonians," said Margaret Van Vliet, Director of Oregon Housing and Community Services. "Our agency has a vision that all Oregonians will have the opportunity to pursue prosperity and live free from poverty. We know the Oregonians who will move into these apartments across the state will have the opportunity to achieve this. We also know there is more to do to ensure every Oregonian can access safe and affordable housing." Units which will be built or rehabilitated through these awards will provide housing for veterans, families needing a place to recover from addiction, elderly residents living on fixed incomes, and people with disabilities. Oregon Housing and Community Services provides financing and support through community based and private sector partners in furthering the state's goals, and the agency will continue to provide funds to build and preserve stable and affordable housing in order to ensure more Oregonians have access to opportunity.

| Governor's Office |                  | Governor Kitzhaber announces additional federal funding for Oregon recreation and conservation projects | Oregon will receive $657,659 from the Land and Water Conservation Fund this year                                       | 2014-07-07T00:00:00 | 2014         | Salem | OR    |                | (Salem, OR) ? Governor Kitzhaber today announced that Oregon will receive more than $650,000 from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for outdoor recreation and conservation projects. The funding is part of $43.38 million that will be distributed nationwide this year. Oregon's allotment brings the state's all-time total from the Fund to more than $55 million. "The Land and Water Conservation Fund has directly supported projects that improve Oregonians' quality of life," said Governor Kitzhaber. "Urban parks, natural areas, ball fields, and trails give Oregonians the chance to explore their state while improving the health and vitality of our cities and towns. This funding is critical to protecting natural areas and supporting locally-driven projects that improve livability." This morning, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell praised the Fund as one of the nation's most effective tools for creating and protecting urban parks and natural areas. Today in Welches, Neil Kornze, Director of the Bureau of Land Management, will celebrate the Fund's 50th anniversary at the Sandy Ridge mountain bike trail system near the Sandy River. The trail system was made possible by the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was established by Congress in 1964 to ensure access to outdoor recreation by providing money to federal, state, and local governments to purchase land, water, and wetlands. Over the past 50 years, Oregon has used the funding to create a full range of outdoor recreation, from public plazas like Pioneer Square in downtown Portland to full-service state parks like Stub Stewart in Washington County. "Oregon has blossomed under 50 years of investment from the Land and Water Conservation Fund," says Lisa Van Laanen, Director of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. ( http://oregonstateparks.org/ ) "Thousands of projects - large and small, state and city and county - have improved access to public recreation in every region of Oregon." The Fund's primary source of revenue comes from federal oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. The amount allocated to each state is determined by a formula established in the original legislation. The fund in turn boosts local economies by supporting jobs in the outdoor recreation and tourism industries. A recent analysis of the Fund found that every $1 invested in land acquisition generated a $4 return on the investment for communities.

Governor Kitzhaber joined President Obama today at the White House to call on companies across the nation to invest in America at an ?Insourcing American Jobs? forum. The forum focused on the increasing trend of insourcing ? where companies are bringing jobs back to the United States and making additional investments here in America. Governor Kitzhaber joined the President, Vice President, members of the Cabinet and other Senior Administration Officials along with representatives from companies that have brought jobs back or decided to make significant investments in the United States. ?Today I am meeting with companies who chose to invest in the one country with the most productive workers, best universities, and most creative and innovative entrepreneurs in the world: the United States of America,? said President Obama. ?That's exactly the kind of commitment to country we need ? especially now, at this make-or-break moment for the middle class. And I'm calling on those businesses that haven't brought jobs back to take this opportunity to get the American people back to work. That's how we'll rebuild an economy where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded ? and a nation where those values live on.? ?I stand with the President today in his call to bring jobs back to America,? said Governor Kitzhaber. ?To maintain our manufacturing base and to encourage even more production in Oregon, we need to have a long-term business plan, an educational system that provides students and workers with advanced skills, reliable and affordable energy, and an environment that encourages investment by lowering fixed costs such as healthcare. We are working on all these things, and following through on them will mean a sustained and robust advanced manufacturing sector in Oregon.? Governor Kitzhaber was asked to participate in the discussion and share the Oregon story along with James Curleigh, CEO of KEEN, Inc. and Brian Krzanich, Senior Vice President, General Manager, Manufacturing and Supply Chain of Intel Corporation.

| Governor's Office |                  | Oregon small business lending programs awarded additional $5.6 million                                  | Funds administered by Business Oregon are expected to help Oregon small businesses access up to $56 million of capital | 2014-03-10T00:00:00 | 2014         | Salem | OR    |                | (Salem, OR) ? Governor Kitzhaber and Business Oregon announced today that Oregon has secured an additional $5.6 million in funding for the state's small businesses through a third disbursement from the U.S. Treasury Department's State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). ?We're pleased that our previous success has been rewarded with an additional $5.6 million to fund the growth of Oregon's small business community,? said Governor Kitzhaber. ?In partnership with banks around the state, we hope to leverage these funds with private capital to help deliver as much as $56 million in lending for our state's economy.? Oregon's third disbursement of SSBCI funds from the U.S. Treasury comes after Business Oregon successfully lent $10.6 million, or 97 percent, of funding in its first two disbursements. The state was awarded a total allocation of $16.5 million in August 2011. To date, the federal funds have generated over $90 million in private sector financing to more than 160 Oregon small businesses. ?Our team has used SSBCI funds to provide nearly $100 million in low-interest loans and loan guarantees to Oregon small business owners in every corner of our state,? said Business Oregon Director Tim McCabe. For example, Business Oregon used SSBCI funds to make a $200,000, low-interest loan to Drink Tanks Corp., a Bend-based company that manufactures stainless-steel beer growlers. ?The Oregon Business Development Fund loan allowed Drink Tanks to scale up, open West Coast distribution channels, and hire both production and office staff,? said Nicholas Hill, Drink Tanks' CEO. SSBCI was created by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama on September 27, 2010. The $1.5 billion program is expected to spur up to $15 billion in new lending to small businesses and manufacturers as states use federal funds to leverage private investment dollars. Oregon's SSBCI funding is distributed through Business Oregon's business finance programs including the Oregon Business Development Fund (OBDF): http://www.oregon4biz.com/Business-financing-resources/Oregon-Finance-Programs/Oregon-Business-Development-Fund/ , the Credit Enhancement Fund (CEF) and the Capital Access Program (CAP): http://www.oregon4biz.com/Business-financing-resources/Oregon-Finance-Programs/Oregon-Capital-Access-Program/ .
