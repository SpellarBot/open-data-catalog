## Description

NNDSS - Table I. infrequently reported notifiable diseases - 2015.  In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.  Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnote:-: No reported cases    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ??? Case counts for reporting year  2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. ?? Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. The total sum of incident cases is then divided by 25 weeks. Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf. ?? Data for the Arboviral disease, Chikungunya, and Hantavirus infection disease, non-Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), will be displayed in this table after the CDC obtains Office of Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Act approval to receive data for these conditions. ** Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II. ????? Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html.  ???? Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II. ???? Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. *** Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. ??????? Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II. ?????? Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. ?????? Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. **** Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. See Table II for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.
