## Description

A project of the EdLab Group, Communities Connect Network (CCN) is a statewide coalition of public and private organizations working to make Washington State a leader in ?digital inclusion? ? the movement to ensure that all individuals have access and the skills to use the Internet and information technologies.

CCN brings together community technology providers with state and local governments, corporate, philanthropic, and individual supporters to ensure that all residents are able to fully participate in Washington?s increasingly technology-rich society.

Most recently, CCN is the recipient of federal Department of Commerce NTIA Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) funding for public computing centers. The Communities Connect Network Project works to improve broadband adoption rates, workforce preparation, digital literacy, access to education, justice resources, and training at 22 sites in seven counties around Washington State. Partners include non-profits, libraries, community centers and courthouses. See BTOP Computer Labs for a complete list of partners.

These skills require youth to become technologically fluent. We also realize that computers, software, and networking do not, by themselves, lead to the development of technological fluency. In creating the Clubhouse , we needed to consider not only new technologies, but also new forms of social interaction, new types of activities, new areas of knowledge, and new attitudes towards learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Human Services/Non-profit (non-residential) | English          |                                      | 10                  | Windows        | None                  |                            | No Wi-Fi        | Audio productionVideo production | Youth: Pre-teen, Youth: Teen                                                                       |                            | Limited Users  |

More than 50 languages are spoken in the complex. This 326-unit property is managed by the King County Housing Authority. As a gathering place for the Windsor Heights community since 1999, our facilities sit at the center of the complex, and are a central part of the community. Each year, hundreds of residents attend our community-led Cultural Festival. Teens in our program recruit volunteers, advertise, and design activities for kids. After School Program students make flags of their countries as decoration. And families plan a rich menu of food and entertainment. The vibrant Cultural Festival encourages neighbors to come together to meet and celebrate each other. | Housing                                     | English, Spanish |                                      | 8                   | Windows        | None                  |                            | No Wi-Fi        |                                  | On-site Residents                                                                                  |                            | Limited Users  |
