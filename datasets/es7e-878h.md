## Description

This dataset contains the final posting language for agenda items and links to backup materials for meetings of the Austin City Council. Complete information on Council meetings and agenda items can be found at the Council Meeting Information Center (http://austintexas.gov/department/city-council/council-meetings).

There are two URLs associated with each agenda item. The SireLinkWithDraftBackup contains DRAFT backup material that is updated each business day prior to the meeting at approximately 4:00p.m. Please note that updated or additional backup materials that are submitted the day of the Council meeting are not included in the SireLinkWithDraftBackup URL. However, the LinkToClerksWebsite URL contains the COMPLETE backup material for each agenda item, including any materials presented at the Council meeting. This URL becomes active approximately 24 hours after the meeting.

This dataset only includes finalized posting language for Council meeting agendas. For individuals interested in receiving notifications when draft agendas become available, please sign up for the Austin City Council Draft Agenda list at https://www.austintexas.gov/notes. Draft agendas are made available one week prior to the finalized Council meeting agenda and are subject to change.
