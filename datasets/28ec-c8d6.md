## Description

This dataset reflects incidents that have been reported to the New Orleans Police Department in 2011. Data is provided by Orleans Parish Communication District (OPCD), the administrative office of 9-1-1 for the City of New Orleans. In the OPCD system, NOPD may reclassify or change the signal type for up to 36 hours after the incident is marked up. For information about an incident after this time period, citizens may request police reports from the NOPD Public Records Division.  In order to protect the privacy of victims, addresses are shown at the block level and the call types cruelty to juveniles, juvenile attachment and missing juvenile have been removed in accordance with the Louisiana Public Records Act, L.R.S. 44:1.  Map coordinates (X,Y) have been removed for the following call types: Aggravated Rape, Aggravated Rape - MA, Crime Against Nature, Mental Patient, Oral Sexual Battery, Prostitution, Sexual Battery, Simple Rape, and Soliciting for Prost.Disclaimer: These incidents may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the New Orleans Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time.
