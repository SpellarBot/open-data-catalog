One of the top 10 initiatives outlined in the Transformation Plan is Open Government.  H.B. 632 aligns to this initiative, and thus we strongly support the intent of the bill.  The Office of Information Management and Technology (OIMT) clearly supports making government more open and transparent.  The State provides a wealth of information and data that we are making more accessible and interactive through our open data portal at www.data.hawaii.gov, which has been federated with groundbreaking federal open data site www.data.gov.  The open data portal is one example of how the State is proactively aggregating disparate data and information to make it more accessible and user-friendly, eliminating the need for visitors to have to ?hunt and peck? to find what they are looking for.  Open data builds trust among citizens by making government more transparent with the sharing of information.  Open data also encourages innovation with developers as they create applications from the information available to address specific needs of the community, whether its constituents tracking the spending of candidates or parents looking for the nearest playground or park for their keiki or anything in between.  Most importantly, open data encourages citizen participation and engagement with their government.  With support from the Governor, OIMT launched its Open Data Initiative on June 26, 2012 asking all departments and attached agencies to contribute datasets to the open data portal and to name Open Data Coordinators to work with OIMT to further build out the information offered to the public. The State has the opportunity to leapfrog to the front of the pack in terms of open government and open data by developing innovative applications and continuing to make the raw data behind these applications open and available.  This is the public?s information and we want to make it available in as many ways as we can.  OIMT is working to create a new paradigm regarding data, believing that it should be open by default unless there is a compelling reason ? usually privacy or security-related ? to keep it closed." t:category=Notices t:title="Open Data Legislation" t:agency="CIO, State of Hawaii" t:slug=DEF0B678-8E64-415C-94D0-72D39362E1F7 m:row_number.53b5-749p=2

| 1  | Welcome to data.hawaii.gov | 2012-10-04T00:00:00 | Today marks the official launch of Hawaii?s all-new Open Data portal. We?re excited to be taking another step towards improving accountability and the way we deliver key services across the State. As we launch, I?d like to take a moment to talk about what we?re so thrilled about, and what this means for you.
The State of Hawaii has partnered with Socrata to create a powerful Open Data experience that makes it incredibly easy to explore, transform and share data. On our portal, you?ll find a wealth of resources ranging from detailed budget and expenditure data and charts of lobbyist contributions, to maps of public hurricane shelters.
Our vision is to use this platform as a catalyst to address a number of key challenges that the State of Hawaii is committed to solving. I?ve outlined three of them below:
1) Improving Transparency and Accountability
I mentioned before that some of the data we?re making available includes detailed insight into the State budget, expenditures and contributions from lobbyists. We wanted to provide a platform that is accessible to anyone at any location, and do so in an easily navigable, consolidated environment that makes it easy to find state information resources. In doing this, we aim to improve citizens? understanding of how we apply public resources, with the end goal of holding ourselves more accountable and transparent.
2) Economic Development
Data.Hawaii.Gov places a huge emphasis on economic development and modernizing how key government services are delivered. We want to enable you to see and understand how the economy has changed over time, and why, in order to drive data-driven decisions about how we can stimulate economic growth across the state. Just as importantly, we want to use this portal itself to drive economic growth. Every dataset is API-enabled, allowing developers to easily build powerful applications driven by up-to-date government data. Proud owner of a Chevy Volt or a Nissan Leaf? Our API-enabled public charging stations dataset can be turned into a mobile locator app, showing all of the places where you can get your car charged across the state.
3) Enabling Citizen Participation
Hawaii?s Open Data site also allows State residents to engage with their government, contributing feedback and ideas for how we can improve our Open Data portal. This isn?t the end of the road for our Open Data efforts?we plan to constantly grow and evolve based on citizen feedback, and can?t wait to see your ideas take shape. With that vision in mind, we?re empowering you, the resident, to transform data into unique maps and charts, share contributions on social networks, or embed datasets into your personal blogs.
So, when you have a moment today, I encourage you to explore data.hawaii.gov. Don?t be afraid to get your hands dirty digging through this data. Find something interesting? Share it and spark a discussion?after all, that?s one of the many things open data is all about. | 4335    | Sonny Bhagowalia |                    | DEF0B678-8E64-415C-94D0-72D39362E1F7 | CIO, State of Hawaii | Notices  |

OIMT is working to create a new paradigm regarding data, believing that it should be open by default unless there is a compelling reason ? usually privacy or security-related ? to keep it closed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         | Sonny Bhagowalia |                    | DEF0B678-8E64-415C-94D0-72D39362E1F7 | CIO, State of Hawaii | Notices  |
