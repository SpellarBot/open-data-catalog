| Clean Steam Piping Replacement                                       | CC Health & Hospitals System  | Health & Hospital Systems  | DESCRIPTION This project will repair and replace corroded piping and components on the clean steam system at the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County (JSH). The Hospital has two separate steam producing systems, heating and clean steam. The central boiler plant, used to generate steam for heat, is a closed system. Condensate is pumped back to the central boiler plant, treated and reused. The central boiler plant feeds the clean steam system. Clean steam is then generated by six independent generators. The clean steam condensate lines, components and fittings have been subject to severe corrosion and leaks. Continuous problems and damage include but are not limited to: * Deterioration of the supply and condensate piping, threaded joints, elbows, steam traps, jacketed kettles, etc. * Staining and corrosion in Autoclaves and kitchen equipment and staining of sterilized medical equipment and utensil * Humidifiers leaking into the ductwork and hospital spaces and improperly sized humidifiers * Clogged steam generator tube bundles ENGINEERING CONSULTANT: WMA Consultant Engineers, Ltd. | 1312873200 | 1382943600 |

| CORE Center, Roof - Replace Air Cooled System                        | CC Ruth Rothstein Core Center | Health & Hospital Systems  | The existing Chiller at the Core Center has reached the end of its useful life. The Chiller has been in place since the building was constructed in 1998. The chilling capacity on the unit is approximately 400 Tons. While the Chiller is still in operation, it is not operating as efficiently and effectively to meet the designed cooling loads. With the Core Center primarily handling of infectious diseases, the unit needs to be replaced in order to ensure that the Core Center can maintain a temperature controlled environment. The scope of this project includes: Design of a new Chiller System Calculating mechanical, electrical, and structural loads Removal of the existing Chiller System Patching wall penetrations Repair / Replace existing pipe supports and hangers Cleaning & patching abandoned pipes in the walls & ceilings Replacement of existing pipe valves, conduits, and panels                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 1294387200 | 1326182400 |
