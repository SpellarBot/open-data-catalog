## Description

The Imagine Austin comprehensive plan calls for an analysis and assessment of indicators or metrics that can be used to measure progress after the plan's fifth year.  Many of the indicators were suggested and not completely scoped, and some were aspirational, or not measurable at the time.  The indicators presented here are those that staff proposes for intense analysis after year five.  The associated data was the most current at the time collected, and serves as a baseline to compare to future numbers.  The "Additional Indicators" available at https://data.austintexas.gov/Government/Draft-Additional-Imagine-Austin-Indicators/7dis-buys includes many of the other indicators in the plan.  These are primarily tracked by other entities, or not deemed as highly relevant and therefore may not receive the same level of analysis.  Indicators may be revised as new techniques or data become available.

Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished. | Vacancy status has long been used as a basic indicator of the housing market and provides information on the stability and quality of housing for certain areas. The data is used to assess the demand for housing, to identify housing turnover within areas, and to better understand the population within the housing market over time. These data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of persons at different economic levels. | According to the Neighborhood Housing and Community Development (NHCD) Fiscal Year 2013-2014 Community Needs Assessment,housing vacancy fell below 8% in 2011. There was a 2.7 percent increase in the number of housing units from 2009 to 2010.
