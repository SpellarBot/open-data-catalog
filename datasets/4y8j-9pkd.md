## Description

Through the Permanent Art Program, Arts for Transit commissions public art that is seen by millions of city-dwellers as well as national and international visitors who use the MTA?s subways and trains. Arts for Transit works closely with the architects and engineers at MTA NYC Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, to determine the parameters and sites for the artwork that is to be incorporated into each station scheduled for renovation. Both well-established and emerging artists contribute to the growing collection of works created in the materials of the system -mosaic, ceramic, tile, bronze, steel and glass. Artists are chosen through a competitive process that uses selection panels comprised of visual arts professionals and community representatives which review and select artists. This data provides the branch or station and the artist and artwork information.

Fragments of the old Penn Station are hidden in the lower depths of the building that replaced it, and the murals symbolically reveal the old building now hidden behind new walls. *In {Day and Night}, a 500-square-foot-mural in the main concourse, Leicester reinterprets Adolph Wineman's sculpture of the same name that presided over the old station's entrances, depicting two women flanking a gigantic clock. The artist embedded the date the original building was demolished - 10/28/63 - into the clock's blank face.

I'm asking for a one-on-one relationship between the viewer and the work, the artist says. The large metal sculpture, installed overhead in the Long Island Rail Road's main concourse at Penn Station, combines industrial craftsmanship with contemporary technology to tell time. When people think about clocks they usually envision hands or digital numbers, explains Lin. Time is measured mathematically and specifically. I wanted to reflect time naturally and chose to use the concept of an eclipse. To create this effect, a solid disk hangs between the light source and a stationary glass disk. Light shines through the glass disk, illuminating the rotunda below. The solid disk travels from east to west and back. An eclipse is created at midnight, as the two disks are aligned and only a penumbra of light shines around the aligned circles. The cycle is repeated daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=pennstation&artist=2&station=1, null]         |

The area around Hicksville was once a notable rarity, an example of an original prairie landscape most often associated with the Midwest. Nicholson recaptures that setting, in look and spirit, as if seen from a speeding train. The colors vary according to the time of day depicted - soft green and blue hues for sunrise in {Morning Transit}, and red and blue hues for sunset in {Evening Transit}. Each commuter imagines his or her own personal scenery, says Nicholson. One can look at it over and over again and discover new images. The artist creates a contemplative meditation on landscape and rewards the viewer with an affectionate look back at Long Island before the post-war housing boom forever altered the landscape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=portjeffersonbranch&artist=1&station=2, null] |
