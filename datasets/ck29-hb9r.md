      While we want our students to be independent and discerning learners, we also would like them to be team learners as well.

In this way learning can lead to creative solutions to life's challenges.</p>" t:quality=gold t:ages_served="0 years to 6 years" t:other_features="Accepts CCAP" t:accreditation=NAEYC m:key=215

| 1492686137  | 215 | Allison's Infant and Toddler Center - Englewood      | Allison's Infant & Toddler Center's philosophy is to provide high quality of service to children between the ages of 6 weeks-6 years old from various ethnic back grounds. Although, we speak the English language primarily, we have a strong desire to share our differences, some of which stem from the way we learn and which also, contribute to our communal an intellectual richness. We believe that a structured program which addresses the development of the child holistically, physical, intellectual, social and emotional make-up will better enhance the child for future endeavors. While we want our students to be independent and discerning learners, we also would like them to be team learners as well. Above all, we want our students to be able to apply their skills in the new, the unknown, and the unpredictable. In this way learning can lead to creative solutions to life's challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 5522 S Racine Ave    | Chicago | IL    | 60636 | (773) 436-3193 | http://www.allisonsinfantandtoddler.com                      | 0 years to 6 years  | true     | true     | Full Week, Part Week, Full Day, Part Day |                | Community Based, Head Start                   |                              | Accepts CCAP   | NAEYC                       | gold     | Gold           | 41.79308499999998  | -87.65520699999999 |

| 1492686137  | 243 | Chicago Commons Association - NIA Family Center      | Nia Family Center is located in West Humboldt Park and is part of the Chicago Commons (Commons) program. Commons offers a rich educational approach to families and communities with limited resources, and adapts services to the needs of the people and communities it serves. All Commons classrooms have both English and Spanish speaking staff members. At Commons a comprehensive early education program is offered (Head Start/Early Head Start), as well as a comprehensive approach to complete parent/guardian engagement. Chicago Commons believes that education must involve the entire family.
Chicago Commons is a leader in using the Reggio Emilia approach to education. Reggio Emilia is an educational philosophy that views the preschool years as crucial to the development of children as individuals. Based on the principles of respect, responsibility, parent and community engagement, the Reggio approach empowers children to author their learning process.
In Reggio, the parent, teacher and surrounding environment are all considered co-teachers of a child?s education. Chicago Commons is one of the few Head Start programs in Illinois that uses the approach. Educators from around the country have visited its schools to observe Reggio Emilia inspired practices.
Other services offered at each early education school:
Mental health services for families and children that assist in emotional, cognitive and social development
60 minutes of exercise daily
A registered dietitian creates and approves the menu for nutritional content
Two thirds of a child?s recommended daily food intake is provided
The Family Hub program is integrated in each of the early learning schools, and offers specific services for parents outside of normal school hours. These services can include:
Educational attainment
Job readiness, training and search skills
Financial management
ESL
Digital literacy
Health, wellness, nutritional eating and exercise classes
Commons? schools are all NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children) accredited based on the quality of learning environment, program administration, and provider qualifications and training. | 744 N Monticello Ave | Chicago | IL    | 60624 | (773) 722-0115 | www.chicagocommons.org                                       | 8 weeks to 5 years  | true     | true     | Full Week, Part Week, Full Day, Part Day |                | Community Based, Head Start, Early Head Start |                              | Accepts CCAP   | NAEYC                       | gold     | Gold           | 41.89472           | -87.717692         |
