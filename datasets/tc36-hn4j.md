Ruiz Branch was once the Riverside Drive Branch, at the time one of the smallest branches in the Austin Public Library system. The branch got its start in November of 1968 when APL opened the Montopolis Branch in a neighborhood shopping center at 735 Montopolis Drive. It replaced a busy APL bookmobile that for over a year was stationed outside a nearby community center. In 1983, having outgrown the space, the Montopolis Branch was moved to the Rivertowne Mall and renamed the Riverside Drive Branch. In 1991, after receiving a federal grant in 1990 to open a Job Information Center which demanded more space, the branch moved to a new location within the Riverside Place Shopping Center. The Job Information Center was retired in 1996. In 1998, Austin citizens voted to replace the facility with one of the largest APL branches to date. The new facility opened in January 2004 as the Daniel E. Ruiz* Branch, located at Riverside Drive and Grove Boulevard. The yard of the Ruiz Branch is home to Discovery, a sculpture by Will Larson provided by the Austin Art in Public Places Program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

In 1982, it was relocated to retail space within the Century South shopping center at the intersection of E. William Cannon and IH-35, and renamed the Century South Branch. Five years later, it moved again, but this time to a permanent facility. It was named Pleasant Hill because it stands on the hill that serves as the focal point and namesake for the area. In 2000, the interior and exterior?of the branch were renovated and an outdoor council ring sitting area was installed, peacefully situated under a shady cluster of oak trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
