On April 20th, 1988, hundreds of parents, students, staff, and supporters protested plans to close the school by joining hands and forming a circle around the historic building, chanting ?Be cool, save our school.?   District officials cited the high costs of maintaining the 82 year old structure, while supporters cited the advantages of a multi-ethnic urban environment and the quality of academic programs. A lawsuit was filed, challenging the district?s decision to close the school and, in January 1989 King Co. Superior Court ruled the closure could proceed. University Heights Elementary closed it?s doors in early 1989.  Unwilling to let this community resource and historic landmark be lost, local residents, parents, and area businesses who had tried to save the school, organized and reopened the facility as the neighborhood organization - the University Heights Center for the Community Association (UHCCA), on May 1st, 1989.  This organization was formed by a group of citizens who believed that this building should continue to be used for growth, learning and the community. The University Heights Center maintains the belief that  ""Old Schools Still Teach"" and continues to focus on building neighborhood and providing opportunities for learning and growth in a historical setting." t:agency_id=1.0316343701E10 t:zip=98105.0 t:description="University Heights Center for the Community Association (UHCCA) is a not-for profit 501C-3 organization now serving the U District and Greater Seattle area for almost 20 years.

For over a century, this building has served the community?s children as a public school, and now continues to serve over 130,000 people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities annually with over 150 groups utilizing classroom space for ongoing classes, programs and workshops, and more.  The Center is home to a variety of long-term tenants. These include the University District Farmer?s Market, The Northwest Choirs, Broadway Bound Children?s Theatre, a K-5 school - Academy for Precision Learning, and a German language immersion pre-school/kindergarten ? the Seattle Area German American School(SAGAS). The focus of these organizations range from arts & education, to community and personal growth, to sustainability and political action.   Daytime events include children's music classes, local organization meetings and yoga classes. Evening courses in dance, languages, community development, and martial arts are conducted every evening. UHCCA's annual program, U Heights Plaza Days Program operates at the same time as the spring to fall Farmer?s Market every Saturday, hosts the annual U District Community Cleanup and hosts a variety of ongoing classes, activities and workshops.

Activities outside the home are centered in classrooms, therapy cubicles, physicians' offices, and hospital waiting rooms. I never hear the word fun mentioned."" These observations by Seattle Children's PlayGarden Executive Director Liz Bullard prompted her to form the PlayGarden in 2002. Liz, a Seattle speech/language pathologist, had sought outdoor play spaces that were both accommodating and nurturing for children with special needs. Her research revealed a striking lack of safe and accessible outdoor learning environments in Seattle/King County. She approached Ken Bounds, former Seattle Parks and Recreation Department Superintendent, about this finding. Mr. Bounds agreed, and offered the Department's support for developing this program.  In 2003, the Seattle Parks Department offered the south end of Colman Playfield, at 24th Avenue South and South Grand Street, as the site for a public-private development. The PlayGarden eagerly accepted the offer of this site for the opportunity it presented to involve the residents of the surrounding economically and ethnically diverse neighborhoods and its easy access for families of children with disabilities from all over King County. A 10-year renewable, no-cost lease for the site was ratified by the Seattle City Council in September of 2006.  The PlayGarden became a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in July 2003, and is led by a volunteer board of directors along with Ms. Bullard. A volunteer advisory board and leadership council now assist the group. Committee members have expertise in children's health, children with special needs, gardening, and various business and social services professions.  In 2004, schematic designs and engineering studies were completed for the garden and associated facilities. Construction will be completed in 5 phases. Phase I is complete, and involved moving an existing basketball court on the site, and improving its design to accommodate wheelchair athletes. The court also includes adjustable hoops to encourage children to play.  Construction documents for renovation of an existing Shelter House and a new Garden House have been completed. The permitting process is underway and we are bidding the project, with a groundbreaking anticipated in fall 2008 and completion by September 2009. We are still accepting donations toward our capital campaign, and need to raise $90,000 from individuals. When these facilities are in place, programming will occur year-round.  In the meantime, the PlayGarden has held summer programs since 2006. All programs integrate children with special needs with typically developing children. Programs are often multi-age, to maximize the opportunity for siblings and friends to attend together. Throughout the year, the PlayGarden holds informal planting parties, play dates, and celebrations, such as our Earth Day event in April, Summer Barbecue in August, and Harvest Festival in October." t:agency_id=1.0296588077E10 t:zip=98114.0 t:description="Digging in the dirt, swinging in the sunshine, chasing butterflies. All kids deserve these simple pleasures. At the Seattle Children's PlayGarden, all kids can enjoy the outdoors?kids on two feet, kids with walkers, kids in wheelchairs, kids who communicate differently.  The Seattle Children's PlayGarden is a nonprofit organization providing children of all abilities full access to outdoor recreation space and offering inclusive programs that encourage every child's potential. The PlayGarden provides a well-designed, safe, and supportive environment to interact with nature, to learn, to explore, and to create. Here children will enhance their cognitive, motor, and social skills?and develop their sense of wonder and independence.  Until now, children with physical limitations, such as cerebral palsy, or developmental delays, such as autism, have been largely excluded from participation in local outdoor activity areas. Parents of children with special needs have had few options of enjoyable yet safe and supported outdoor learning experiences for their fragile children. The PlayGarden offers options for these families that will accommodate not only the children with special needs in the family, but the typically developing children as well." t:agency_name_sort_key="SEATTLE CHILDRENS PLAYGARDEN" t:street="3710 38th Avenue South" t:main_phone_number="(206) 227-5458" t:purpose="Our Mission  The Seattle Children's PlayGarden seeks to improve the lives of children with physical or mental disabilities by providing them with full access to a safe indoor/outdoor recreation space and offering inclusive programs that encourage their potential.

YOUTH EDUCATION: EARN A BIKE: Kids, Bikes, & Sweat Equity In our signature Earn-A-Bike program, kids build skills and self-confidence as they work with their hands and learn how to repair bikes. They also experience what it means to give back to their community, as they contribute community service hours refurbishing bikes which are donated to local nonprofits. After logging 18 hours of community service, kids earn their own bikes and build them with their own hands!  In 2008, we offered six EAB classes ? two per school quarter. Our classroom is at maximum capacity with ten students, making our total EAB participation 67 youth in 2008. Sixty-one percent of those youth earned their own bikes, along with locks and, of course, helmets! YOUTH VENTURES: Ride It Like You Earned It! Our Youth Ventures program keeps youth from our Earn-A-Bike and partnership classes engaged in bicycling. It is not enough to help kids earn bikes and learn to fix them; without support and a riding partner, it is difficult to make cycling a part of their regular activities. In 2008, our Youth Ventures program (code-name ?Street Burners? for the youth) engaged 501 youth in 86 activities - including neighborhood rides, safety rodeos, field trips to community and cycling events, mountain biking, BMX trick riding, and track racing. Our tag-line ?Ride It Like You Earned It!? captures the spirit of this program.  SUMMER TOURING CAMPS: In 2008 Bike Works offered five summer riding camps, including three self-supported bicycle touring camps. We developed these programs to give our youth participants the opportunity to experience the natural environment of the Pacific Northwest, and to encourage bicycling as an alternative and fun means of transportation. COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS: Many youth in the neighborhoods we serve don?t have opportunities to become involved in after-school activities, and can?t attend our regular EAB classes. Our Community Partnerships program connects us with schools and community organizations to reach youth underserved by after-school opportunities.   2. COMMUNITY BIKE SHOP: Each and every bicycle donated, refurbished, and recycled back into the community is one less bike in the landfill, and potentially one less car on the road.  Our bike shop sells affordable, refurbished bicycles, and runs entirely on bikes donated from people just like you! One hundred percent of income raised in our shop goes to support youth programming - accounting for over 50% of our annual operating revenue.   3. BICYCLE DISTRIBUTION & EXPORTS: A great deal of our resources and time is dedicated to returning defunct bicycles to the streets of Seattle. After a bicycle is fixed up by an Earn-A-Bike student or a volunteer, it may be repatriated to the community in a number of different ways. FareStart, a restaurant jobs-training program that helps homeless adults turn their lives around, receives Bike Works bikes for each graduate. Additionally, we donate extensively to Treehouse, a resource center for foster families. In 2007, we recycled 250 bikes back into the community, donated 138 bikes to local nonprofit organizations, distributed 162 bikes to youth through our programs and annual Kids Bike Swap, sent 1,410 bicycles to villages in Ghana, and recycled many tons of scrap metal!" t:agency_name_sort_key="BIKE WORKS" t:street="3709 S.

On April 20th, 1988, hundreds of parents, students, staff, and supporters protested plans to close the school by joining hands and forming a circle around the historic building, chanting ?Be cool, save our school.? District officials cited the high costs of maintaining the 82 year old structure, while supporters cited the advantages of a multi-ethnic urban environment and the quality of academic programs. A lawsuit was filed, challenging the district?s decision to close the school and, in January 1989 King Co. Superior Court ruled the closure could proceed. University Heights Elementary closed it?s doors in early 1989. Unwilling to let this community resource and historic landmark be lost, local residents, parents, and area businesses who had tried to save the school, organized and reopened the facility as the neighborhood organization - the University Heights Center for the Community Association (UHCCA), on May 1st, 1989. This organization was formed by a group of citizens who believed that this building should continue to be used for growth, learning and the community. The University Heights Center maintains the belief that "Old Schools Still Teach" and continues to focus on building neighborhood and providing opportunities for learning and growth in a historical setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | (206) 527-4278    | 5031 University Way NE                                     | 98105.0 | -122.31368 | 47.66568 |

Our Vision Children of all ages and abilities will enjoy the outdoors in the company of their family and friends.                                                                                                                                                          | Digging in the dirt, swinging in the sunshine, chasing butterflies. All kids deserve these simple pleasures. At the Seattle Children's PlayGarden, all kids can enjoy the outdoors?kids on two feet, kids with walkers, kids in wheelchairs, kids who communicate differently. The Seattle Children's PlayGarden is a nonprofit organization providing children of all abilities full access to outdoor recreation space and offering inclusive programs that encourage every child's potential. The PlayGarden provides a well-designed, safe, and supportive environment to interact with nature, to learn, to explore, and to create. Here children will enhance their cognitive, motor, and social skills?and develop their sense of wonder and independence. Until now, children with physical limitations, such as cerebral palsy, or developmental delays, such as autism, have been largely excluded from participation in local outdoor activity areas. Parents of children with special needs have had few options of enjoyable yet safe and supported outdoor learning experiences for their fragile children. The PlayGarden offers options for these families that will accommodate not only the children with special needs in the family, but the typically developing children as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The lives of families of children with special needs are a constant struggle. Activities outside the home are centered in classrooms, therapy cubicles, physicians' offices, and hospital waiting rooms. I never hear the word fun mentioned." These observations by Seattle Children's PlayGarden Executive Director Liz Bullard prompted her to form the PlayGarden in 2002. Liz, a Seattle speech/language pathologist, had sought outdoor play spaces that were both accommodating and nurturing for children with special needs. Her research revealed a striking lack of safe and accessible outdoor learning environments in Seattle/King County. She approached Ken Bounds, former Seattle Parks and Recreation Department Superintendent, about this finding. Mr. Bounds agreed, and offered the Department's support for developing this program. In 2003, the Seattle Parks Department offered the south end of Colman Playfield, at 24th Avenue South and South Grand Street, as the site for a public-private development. The PlayGarden eagerly accepted the offer of this site for the opportunity it presented to involve the residents of the surrounding economically and ethnically diverse neighborhoods and its easy access for families of children with disabilities from all over King County. A 10-year renewable, no-cost lease for the site was ratified by the Seattle City Council in September of 2006. The PlayGarden became a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in July 2003, and is led by a volunteer board of directors along with Ms. Bullard. A volunteer advisory board and leadership council now assist the group. Committee members have expertise in children's health, children with special needs, gardening, and various business and social services professions. In 2004, schematic designs and engineering studies were completed for the garden and associated facilities. Construction will be completed in 5 phases. Phase I is complete, and involved moving an existing basketball court on the site, and improving its design to accommodate wheelchair athletes. The court also includes adjustable hoops to encourage children to play. Construction documents for renovation of an existing Shelter House and a new Garden House have been completed. The permitting process is underway and we are bidding the project, with a groundbreaking anticipated in fall 2008 and completion by September 2009. We are still accepting donations toward our capital campaign, and need to raise $90,000 from individuals. When these facilities are in place, programming will occur year-round. In the meantime, the PlayGarden has held summer programs since 2006. All programs integrate children with special needs with typically developing children. Programs are often multi-age, to maximize the opportunity for siblings and friends to attend together. Throughout the year, the PlayGarden holds informal planting parties, play dates, and celebrations, such as our Earth Day event in April, Summer Barbecue in August, and Harvest Festival in October. | (206) 227-5458    | 3710 38th Avenue South                                     | 98114.0 | -122.28472 | 47.57028 |

YOUTH EDUCATION: EARN A BIKE: Kids, Bikes, & Sweat Equity In our signature Earn-A-Bike program, kids build skills and self-confidence as they work with their hands and learn how to repair bikes. They also experience what it means to give back to their community, as they contribute community service hours refurbishing bikes which are donated to local nonprofits. After logging 18 hours of community service, kids earn their own bikes and build them with their own hands! In 2008, we offered six EAB classes ? two per school quarter. Our classroom is at maximum capacity with ten students, making our total EAB participation 67 youth in 2008. Sixty-one percent of those youth earned their own bikes, along with locks and, of course, helmets! YOUTH VENTURES: Ride It Like You Earned It! Our Youth Ventures program keeps youth from our Earn-A-Bike and partnership classes engaged in bicycling. It is not enough to help kids earn bikes and learn to fix them; without support and a riding partner, it is difficult to make cycling a part of their regular activities. In 2008, our Youth Ventures program (code-name ?Street Burners? for the youth) engaged 501 youth in 86 activities - including neighborhood rides, safety rodeos, field trips to community and cycling events, mountain biking, BMX trick riding, and track racing. Our tag-line ?Ride It Like You Earned It!? captures the spirit of this program. SUMMER TOURING CAMPS: In 2008 Bike Works offered five summer riding camps, including three self-supported bicycle touring camps. We developed these programs to give our youth participants the opportunity to experience the natural environment of the Pacific Northwest, and to encourage bicycling as an alternative and fun means of transportation. COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS: Many youth in the neighborhoods we serve don?t have opportunities to become involved in after-school activities, and can?t attend our regular EAB classes. Our Community Partnerships program connects us with schools and community organizations to reach youth underserved by after-school opportunities. 2. COMMUNITY BIKE SHOP: Each and every bicycle donated, refurbished, and recycled back into the community is one less bike in the landfill, and potentially one less car on the road. Our bike shop sells affordable, refurbished bicycles, and runs entirely on bikes donated from people just like you! One hundred percent of income raised in our shop goes to support youth programming - accounting for over 50% of our annual operating revenue. 3. BICYCLE DISTRIBUTION & EXPORTS: A great deal of our resources and time is dedicated to returning defunct bicycles to the streets of Seattle. After a bicycle is fixed up by an Earn-A-Bike student or a volunteer, it may be repatriated to the community in a number of different ways. FareStart, a restaurant jobs-training program that helps homeless adults turn their lives around, receives Bike Works bikes for each graduate. Additionally, we donate extensively to Treehouse, a resource center for foster families. In 2007, we recycled 250 bikes back into the community, donated 138 bikes to local nonprofit organizations, distributed 162 bikes to youth through our programs and annual Kids Bike Swap, sent 1,410 bicycles to villages in Ghana, and recycled many tons of scrap metal! |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | (206) 725-9408    | 3709 S.

Camp Long was once a little used, 68 acre corner of the West Seattle Golf Course. In 1937 Seattle Park Board member, Archie Phelps, Judge William Long, Ben Evans of the Seattle Park Department and Clark Schurman, well known Scout leader, expert mountaineer and wilderness camp developer, embarked on a mission. They wanted to acquire and develop this land to make it into a place for organized scouting groups to learn camping skills. They were joined by a committee of representatives of youth groups, City Council members, other concerned citizens and supportive agencies and councils. Together they worked hard to create Camp Long and protect its natural beauty. Schurman Rock -- a climbers dream This major attraction at Camp Long was designed by Clark Schurman. His dream was to build a human-made mountain incorporating every potential rock climbing problem into its design. After taking a winter to make a clay model of the rock, Schurman worked very closely with the W.P.A. workers to create his dream rock. Camp Long was opened to the general public in 1984. Camp Long?s 68 acres and unique recreation features offer visitors an opportunity to explore nature, hike, camp overnight in rustic cabins, rock climb and learn about natural history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | (206) 684-7434    | 5200 35th Ave SW                                           | 98126.0 | -122.37296 | 47.55869 |

PNA-sponsored outreach events such as neighborhood potlucks, beer and wine tastes, street clean-ups, a Halloween carnival and a neighborhood wide garage sale day promote involvement in the community. The Greenwood Senior Center has been serving the Greenwood community since 1974 as part of Senior Services of Seattle/King County. In 2004, Senior Services dropped GSC as one of their programs, in part because of budget reasons. The PNA served as GSC?s fiscal agent until January 2006, when the Center became a PNA program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | (206) 297-0875    | 525 N. 85th St.                                            | 98103.0 | -122.35093 | 47.69037 |

Leveraging our collective expertise and resources, we partner with and strengthen promising nonprofits for maximum community impact. SVP's mission is advance the common good by engaging and connecting a community of philanthropic leaders, strengthening local nonprofits, and catalyzing efforts to accelerate system change.                                                  | Our Model: SVP works much the way venture capital does, by investing both time and expertise in a multi-year partnership. POOLED FUNDS SUPPORT INVESTEES AND SVP SEATTLE: SVP Partners join SVP by making an annual contribution of $5,700 or more. The funds are pooled and used to provide grants to Investees (grant recipients) and support SVP?s programs and operations. Grant funds are used for general operating support and capacity-building projects. WE COLLABORATE WITH OUR INVESTEES: We bring our collective expertise to promising nonprofit organizations, collaborating with them to positively impact our community. Investees are selected through a committee of 10?12 SVP Partners. Once selected, SVP works in concert with the organization to improve upon their ability to deliver effective programs. WE STRENGTHEN THE ORGANIZATION AS A WHOLE: Building upon the programmatic expertise of the Investee, SVP helps the organization strengthen its management practices, strategies and systems. With access to skilled volunteers, professional consultants and management training opportunities, Investees can improve the following: - Board Development and Governance - Leadership Development - Program Evaluation and Performance Management - Financial Management - Fund Development - Information Technology - Marketing, PR and Communications - Human Resources - Strategic Planning - Legal The SVP Organizational Capacity-Building Tool helps Investees evaluate, plan and prioritize how they will strengthen their organization. AN INTENSE MULTI-YEAR PARTNERSHIP: SVP seeks to develop true partnerships with Nonprofits. SVP?s approach is unique, and most nonprofits are not accustomed to a funder being involved with the internal operations of their organization. Once selected, a Lead Partner is assigned to work with each Investee. The Lead Partner assists the Investee in prioritizing their organizational capacity-building goals, developing their annual work plan and coordinating a team of volunteer and paid consultants. Investees participate in an annual review process to measure progress on goals, assess volunteer projects and use of SVP resources. There are generally 20 Investees working with SVP in any given year, and funding relationships with most organizations last between three and five years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | In 1997, Social Venture Partners was the inspiration of former Aldus Corporation President Paul Brainerd. Along with business leaders Scott Oki, Ida Cole, Bill Neukom and, Doug and Maggie Walker, Brainerd founded a new type of philanthropic organization, calling it Social Venture Partners. Through collaboration they believed they could make a bigger impact. The donors ? Partners ? would not only contribute financially, but would offer their time and expertise to build long-term partnerships with nonprofit organizations ? Investees. SVP?s dual mission strives to strengthen nonprofit organizations and nurture philanthropists as engaged and effective givers. Our mission, strategic vision and core values guide us in our efforts. However, our Partners are engaged in many of the decision-making processes, including our four areas of funding: Early Childhood Development, the Environment, K?12 Education, and Out-of-School Time. Through the many opportunities available, Partners gain a rich insight into community issues, the nonprofit sector, giving strategies, and philanthropic and civic leadership. In addition, Partners develop their knowledge of philanthropy through our Partner Education offerings, which include panels, classes and hands-on experiences. Today, more than 420 local Partners contribute their know-how, resources and passion to more than 20 King County organizations. Learning from each other and the groups they support, Partners have provided over 75,000 hours of volunteer consulting and have granted in excess of $10 million to advance promising nonprofits. The local accomplishments of SVP have inspired others to do the same. Now with over 20 affiliates worldwide, SVP is bringing positive social change to communities across the country and around the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | (206) 374-8757    | Seattle Center's NW Rooms (Alki Room), 305 Harrison Street | 98109.0 |            |          |
