It is my view that the permit process and reporting is inadequate and ineffective, given that the private sector may apply/misapply perhaps greater pesticide quantities, without a permit, than licensed applicators. Therefore, the punitive fines hanging over applicators heads is discriminatory.
A risk management approach might be more effective, less intrusive, and more flexible to respond to the spread of invasives that for some species is growing almost exponentially. We have a very short window to nip problems in the bud to save money, time, and prevent ungettable infestations of ivy and holly into regional forests. The paperwork of ECA permits and SEPA reviews criminalizes yardwork and discourages voluntary restoration... the resulting neglect of invasives may be a greater threat than overzealous removal. 
I suggest that you measure pesticide runoff and attach a price/tax to the products sold commensurate with health and environmental risks. 
At the same time, offer annual property tax breaks or bundled utility fee reductions in exchange for tree/vegetative cover, stormwater management, habitat quality (control of invasives), soil health, in which an environmental rating could be optionally exploited by homeowners and property managers." m:row_number.thkm-g7yq=1

There were a few places where the text was easier to understand that in the current version of the permit.  I have a few comments: 
1. In S3.B.1 it would be great if &quot;a licensed pesticide applicator, with the appropriate WSDA License and certification,...&quot; was more specific.  I think it would be more useful to spell out that an &quot;Aquatic Endorsement&quot; is necessary.
2.  The text in S3.D. seems like a good addition.
3. In Appendix A-Definitions under the definition for &quot;Licensed pesticide applicator&quot; it would be great if the need for the &quot;aquatic endorsement&quot; was listed as a requirement for the applicator.
4. On the updated Shoreline Posting Templates, it would be good to change the text to &quot;There are no swimming, fishing, or recreational restrictions&quot;.  Adding &quot;fishing&quot; would be good because I have gotten questions about that in the past by people fishing near where I applied herbicide and the sign doesn't make it clear that is the case." m:row_number.thkm-g7yq=2

The language in S3.D. regarding the protection of native vegetation is too restrictive.  Although a small amount of native vegetation may be unavoidably treated with the target weed, the surrounding native plants quickly recolonize the area at these sites.  With the current language, more time would be spent preparing the site for treatment by searching and covering any non-target plants, than conducting control.  In a worst case interpretation, an aerial spray of anything less than a 100% weed monoculture would be practically impossible if there were any native plants located in the infestation.  My first suggestion is to use the 2012 permit language for native plant protection, especially if there have been no specific complaints driving the language change.  If that is not possible, my recommendation for a language change is:   
S3.D. In identified and/or emergent wetlands and other areas with native vegetation, the Permittee must make reasonable efforts to protect native plants when applying chemicals. 
When and where appropriate, methods of protecting native plants may include but are not limited to: 
&acirc;&euro;&cent; Using a selective herbicide.
&acirc;&euro;&cent; Minimizing overspray.
&acirc;&euro;&cent; Using application techniques such as wicking or injection.
&acirc;&euro;&cent; Temporarily covering non-target vegetation.


Comment 2.  There are several emergent weeds that occur in salt marshes and marine shorelines that do not entirely fit the freshwater weed definition.  Examples of these weeds include non-native cattail, non-native Phragmites, purple loosestrife, non-native beach grass and yellow flag iris.  A new subsection should be added to accommodate this work.

S5. NOTIFICATION AND POSTING REQUIREMENTS
New subsection- Brackish Water Weed Notification and Posting Requirements
For treatment of plants other than Spartina post according to S5.B.2.

Comment 3.  Section S4.B.4.  Please add the product Optima (Helena) to the Adjuvant Table." m:row_number.thkm-g7yq=3
