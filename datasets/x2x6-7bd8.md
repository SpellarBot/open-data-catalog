## Description

This dataset contains records indicating the employment of lobbyist firms by entities that employ lobbyists. Each record represents a registration by the lobbyist firm and employer (client) for one year. 

In some cases, the lobbyist firm may have been hired as a subcontractor by another firm to lobby on behalf of their clients. In these cases, refer to the contractor fields to determine the lobbyist firm that has hired the subcontractor.

This data set contains only records up to the year 2015, and going back ten years from the current year. For records beyond 2015, please see the data set, "Lobbyist Employment Registrations."

Each record provides links to document providing detailed information about the lobbyist firm, employer and nature of the employment.

This data set is being made available for evaluation of the data set format. The data are not complete or presumed to be accurate.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.
