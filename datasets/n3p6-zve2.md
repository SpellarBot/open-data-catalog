No prior experience is necessary, but students are expected to have a serious interest in the two performing arts and be ready to participate in intensive training in daily classes. With consistent practice, our students achieve competence, confidence, good citizenship and maturity - qualities that are the foundation for success in high school. There are culminating violin and dance performances at the end of the school year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Freshmen take both violin and dance; College Now, National Academy for Excellent Teaching (NAFET), Leadership Program, buildOn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Spanish                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                | Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID), Character Education Leadership Program, College Summit, Community Service, National Honor Society, PM School, Saturday School, Student Council, Study Jams; Clubs vary each year according to student interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Baseball, Basketball & JV Basketball, Volleyball                                                                                                               | Basketball, Softball, Volleyball                                                                                        |                                 | Morris Educational Campus Basketball and Volleyball                                                                                                      | McGraw Hill -

Lehman Educational Campus |                             | At Schuylerville Preparatory High School, our aspiration is to graduate disciplined individuals with integrity. Our students leave school with the goal of continuing their education in the service of others and contributing to the common good. Our approach is to take our students through increasingly rigorous phases of learning. In addition to developing our students into college-ready thinkers, our Dream Real Advisory is dedicated to the development of students' professional interests. We assign students to Success Development Coaches who help to identify concrete steps that students must take to realize their interests. This personalized approach supports our students with mentorships, internships and college level courses.
