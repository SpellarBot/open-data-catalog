## Description

The Department of Taxation and Finance annually publishes statistical information on the New York State child and dependent care credit (NYS CDCC).  Summary data are presented for all taxpayers, including full-year New York state residents, part-year residents and nonresidents (where applicable).  Data are presented on a statewide and county-level basis for numbers and amounts of credit claims based on filing status and number of qualifying dependents.  Taxpayers filing ?married separate? generally are not allowed to take the child and dependent care credit.

The tables also include summary information for the New York City child and dependent care credit (NYC CDCC).  The data are presented on a county-level basis for numbers and amounts of credit claims at the aggregate level only.
