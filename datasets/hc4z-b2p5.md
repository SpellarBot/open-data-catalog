## Description

This is part 2 of 2 (containing: Purchasing Decisions; Washer and Dryer; and Miscellaneous); part 1 (https://data.ny.gov/d/e58s-chjh) contains: Property Characteristics; Heating and Cooling; Water Heating; Tenant Appliances; Lighting; and Common Area.  The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), in collaboration with the New York State Department of Public Service (DPS), conducted a statewide residential baseline study (study) from 2011 to 2014 of the single-family and multifamily residential housing segments, including new construction, and a broad range of energy uses and efficiency measures. This dataset includes data from 219 completed Multifamily owner and manager surveys. The types of data collected during the survey cover property characteristics, heating and cooling equipment, water heating equipment, tenant appliances, lighting, purchasing decision, common areas, clothes washing and drying, and miscellaneous equipment. The data is segmented to cover both common space equipment and, to the degree possible, tenant-unit equipment, such as refrigerators or clothes washers that are included in the rental by the building ownership.
