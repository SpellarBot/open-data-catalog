A portion of the County's allocation supports a partnership with Economic Development of Central Oregon (EDCO), a private, non-profit organization that works to diversity the regionss economy by recruiting new companies to the area, helping businesses already located in Deschutes County to expand, and encouraging entrepreneurship. The County's remaining lottery funds are used for grants and cooperative agreements with community partners and non-profit organizations that strive to improve the Deschutes County's economic framework in ancillary ways, such as supporting tourism, providing public transit, and stabilizing families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Deschutes County's video lottery fund and associated programs are administered by a .10 FTE Management Analyst position.
