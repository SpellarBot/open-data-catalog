The CPS Board recently approved a balanced budget for FY 12. ? The money from the lottery is directed to the state?s general fund, not to CPS. The state then distributes funding to school districts throughout Illinois. ? Last year CPS introduced new food service menus that meet or exceed USDA standards. However, CPS continues to review their menu offerings and work with their vendors to provide nutritious food to CPS students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | School Budget Cuts | Kennedy King |
