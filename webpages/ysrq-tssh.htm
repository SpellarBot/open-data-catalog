Limiting its use could prove detrimental in terms of stopping the spread of M. spicatum as well as hinder eradication efforts of Hydrilla verticillata.  Fluridone is also very effective at managing duckweed (Lemna spp., Spirodella spp.), water meal (Wollfia spp.) &amp; Egeria densa.  The main benefit to using Fluridone is that it kills plants slowly, limiting the chances of removing a significant amount of dissolved oxygen from the water column and contributing to a fish kill.  As one can still purchase these plants through ornamental plant gardens, their establishment &amp; subsequent management and eradication need to be considered.  There are a limited number of effective management tools that systemically attack noxious aquatic vegetation and contribute to long term control, it would severely hinder managers by eliminating the use of Fluridone as it is currently allowed.</td>

Please note Don Russell's response to the iron issue. I copy Don's comments and believe this material needs to be added to the Ecology list for phosphorous inactivation products. Gary Darcy president of the Twin Lakes Homeowners Association is out of the country for the next few months but before leaving requested that I make sure his group also is on record in  supporting the addition of iron to the list.  Gary Darcy I believe represents over 500 homeowners.
 
Thanks,

Nathan,

Finely granulated elemental (zero valent) iron has a remarkable ability
to inactivate soluble reactive phosphorus (orthophosphate) by a process
of adsorption of the phosphate ion to the reactive surface of zero valent
iron and its subsequent conversion to an insoluble iron phosphate coating
on the surface of the iron particle.  Zero valent iron has been used for
a number of years now for the removal of pollutants (including phosphate)
from groundwater by passing the pollutant bearing groundwater through a
zero valent iron and sand barrier.

Several years ago I imagined that passing finely granulated zero valent
iron particles through a column of lake water would accomplish the same
thing as passing groundwater through a bed of zero valent iron and began
to conduct a series of bench tests to validate the concept and perfect
the application technique.  The first full scale field experimental
application was conducted this past summer in phosphorus polluted Lake
Lorene located in Federal Way.  

The experimental application involved injecting two hundred pounds (two
five gallon pails) of zero valent iron as a thin slurry just below the
surface of the 54 acre feet of phosphorus polluted water in Lake Lorene. 
The soluble reactive phosphorus concentration prior to treatment in Lake
Lorene was approximately 35 ppb.  The soluble reactive phosphorus
concentration post treatment was below phosphorus concentration test
detection limits as determined by an Ecology certified test laboratory. 
This below phosphorus detection limit condition lasted for two months
after the application of zero valent iron in spite of continual external
phosphorus loading of Lake Lorene from Joe's Creek's inflowing water that
contains very high concentrations (up to 75 ppb) of soluble reactive
phosphorus.

There was no adverse impact on pH or aquatic life as a result of the zero
valent iron application.  The iron phosphate coated iron particles
settled to the bottom of the lake and became incorporated into its
sediment.  Because Lake Lorene is shallow and aerated there is little
likelihood that the iron bound phosphorus will be released back into the
water column.  Even if phosphorus was released from sediment under anoxic
conditions so too would some of the iron become soluble (as ferrous
ions).  When orthophosphate ions and ferrous ions are exposed to
oxygenated near surface (photic zone) water the reduced iron (ferrous
ions) and orthophosphate ions will react to form insoluble iron phosphate
thus inactivating the phosphorus as a nutrient source for cyanobacteria. 
Iron is Mother Nature's natural orthophosphate inactivation chemical. 
Aluminum is not.  Furthermore the sulfate ions released during an
aluminum sulfate treatment are alien to the natural composition of lake
water and harmful to aquatic life.  Under anoxic conditions sulfate ions
are reduced to sulfide ions that combine with iron to form insoluble iron
sulfide thus rendering iron ineffective as a phosphorus inactivator. 

For all the above stated reasons zero valent iron should be included as
an Ecology approved phosphorus inactivation chemical.  Zero valent iron
is compatible with and augments natural lake chemistry, is
environmentally friendly, and relatively simple and inexpensive to apply.

This is something that will add between $500 and $1,000 to the cost of completing noxious aquatic weed control for the clients that require these services.  There should be an exception that the sponsor organization or the homeowners we work for can remove these signs.


This permit keeps one of the primary tools we have to fight toxic algae blooms as experimental when it is completely operational world wide.  Phoslock is a technology that was developed 25 years ago by the Australian National Science Academy.  It sequesters phosphorus with a nontoxic technology and that lowers the carrying capacity for a lake or pond to develop toxic algae blooms.  The alternatives that are allowed are Alum buffered with Sodium Aluminate, this blend can be extremely toxic to fish and there have been two major fish kills from the introduction of these technologies to Washington Lakes in the past few years.  This has occurred when the buffer Sodium Aluminate is added to the mix.  This compound is extremely dangerous to handle.  There are over 20 published papers in peer reviewed scientific journals that support the operational use of this technology, it should be considered operational so there are alternatives to the more toxic technologies to turn back phosphorus pollution. 


In the past decades, Sonar aquatic herbicide has been used to effectively eradicate the invasive aquatic weed Eurasian Milfoil using a whole lake treatment scenario.  This practice would effectively be banned by this permit.  The laws in Washington State prohibit actions that would impair the control of noxious aquatic weeds and not having access to this technology where appropriate would impair Eurasian Milfoil Control Efforts.  In addition, there has been one infestation of Hydrilla in Washington State and that infestation was eradicated using whole lake treatment technology.  If Hydrilla returns, and as a Class A noxious weed its eradication is mandated, this permit will limit the ability to attack this plant." t:name="Terry McNabb" m:row_number.ysrq-tssh=3

2) Fluridone treatments need to remain a viable option for managers &amp;amp; agencies to use to combat Myriophyllum spicatum.  Limiting its use could prove detrimental in terms of stopping the spread of M. spicatum as well as hinder eradication efforts of Hydrilla verticillata.  Fluridone is also very effective at managing duckweed (Lemna spp., Spirodella spp.), water meal (Wollfia spp.) &amp;amp; Egeria densa.  The main benefit to using Fluridone is that it kills plants slowly, limiting the chances of removing a significant amount of dissolved oxygen from the water column and contributing to a fish kill.  As one can still purchase these plants through ornamental plant gardens, their establishment &amp;amp; subsequent management and eradication need to be considered.  There are a limited number of effective management tools that systemically attack noxious aquatic vegetation and contribute to long term control, it would severely hinder managers by eliminating the use of Fluridone as it is currently allowed." t:name="Joshua Cheshier" m:row_number.ysrq-tssh=4

We as property owners and maintenance representatives at the Bayshore East Condominium remove the posted signs along the shore after the swimming and irrigation restrictions expire since they are written on the signs. We do this every year.  Requiring the contractor to come back to the lake after all of the restrictions have expired to remove the few remaining signs will only add additional costs to our treatment program, so we do not feel this requirement is necessary.

Please note Don Russell's response to the iron issue. I copy Don's comments and believe this material needs to be added to the Ecology list for phosphorous inactivation products. Gary Darcy president of the Twin Lakes Homeowners Association is out of the country for the next few months but before leaving requested that I make sure his group also is on record in  supporting the addition of iron to the list.  Gary Darcy I believe represents over 500 homeowners.
 
Thanks,

Nathan,

Finely granulated elemental (zero valent) iron has a remarkable ability
to inactivate soluble reactive phosphorus (orthophosphate) by a process
of adsorption of the phosphate ion to the reactive surface of zero valent
iron and its subsequent conversion to an insoluble iron phosphate coating
on the surface of the iron particle.  Zero valent iron has been used for
a number of years now for the removal of pollutants (including phosphate)
from groundwater by passing the pollutant bearing groundwater through a
zero valent iron and sand barrier.

Several years ago I imagined that passing finely granulated zero valent
iron particles through a column of lake water would accomplish the same
thing as passing groundwater through a bed of zero valent iron and began
to conduct a series of bench tests to validate the concept and perfect
the application technique.  The first full scale field experimental
application was conducted this past summer in phosphorus polluted Lake
Lorene located in Federal Way.  

The experimental application involved injecting two hundred pounds (two
five gallon pails) of zero valent iron as a thin slurry just below the
surface of the 54 acre feet of phosphorus polluted water in Lake Lorene. 
The soluble reactive phosphorus concentration prior to treatment in Lake
Lorene was approximately 35 ppb.  The soluble reactive phosphorus
concentration post treatment was below phosphorus concentration test
detection limits as determined by an Ecology certified test laboratory. 
This below phosphorus detection limit condition lasted for two months
after the application of zero valent iron in spite of continual external
phosphorus loading of Lake Lorene from Joe's Creek's inflowing water that
contains very high concentrations (up to 75 ppb) of soluble reactive
phosphorus.

There was no adverse impact on pH or aquatic life as a result of the zero
valent iron application.  The iron phosphate coated iron particles
settled to the bottom of the lake and became incorporated into its
sediment.  Because Lake Lorene is shallow and aerated there is little
likelihood that the iron bound phosphorus will be released back into the
water column.  Even if phosphorus was released from sediment under anoxic
conditions so too would some of the iron become soluble (as ferrous
ions).  When orthophosphate ions and ferrous ions are exposed to
oxygenated near surface (photic zone) water the reduced iron (ferrous
ions) and orthophosphate ions will react to form insoluble iron phosphate
thus inactivating the phosphorus as a nutrient source for cyanobacteria. 
Iron is Mother Nature's natural orthophosphate inactivation chemical. 
Aluminum is not.  Furthermore the sulfate ions released during an
aluminum sulfate treatment are alien to the natural composition of lake
water and harmful to aquatic life.  Under anoxic conditions sulfate ions
are reduced to sulfide ions that combine with iron to form insoluble iron
sulfide thus rendering iron ineffective as a phosphorus inactivator. 

For all the above stated reasons zero valent iron should be included as
an Ecology approved phosphorus inactivation chemical.  Zero valent iron
is compatible with and augments natural lake chemistry, is
environmentally friendly, and relatively simple and inexpensive to apply.

One is S5E1e Shoreline Posting Requirements
Our lake is only 12 acres(really a pond by State definition) and a requirement to leave the postings up and have the contractor return to take them down would be another expense to us---and most of us, including myself, take the postings down after the required amount of time listed on the poster.  Trust the citizens, we can handle this. There is no public access and we do leave the posting up at the community area for a longer period of time.
 
Two is G2 Right of Entry and Inspection

Under anoxic conditions sulfate ions are reduced to sulfide ions that combine with iron to form insoluble iron sulfide thus rendering iron ineffective as a phosphorus inactivator. 

For all the above stated reasons zero valent iron should be included as an Ecology approved phosphorus inactivation chemical.  Zero valent iron is compatible with and augments natural lake chemistry, is environmentally friendly, and relatively simple and inexpensive to apply.

My name is Mike Ficker and have been a lakefront resident on Lake Killarney for 18 years. I have reviewed your agency&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s draft NPDES permit and have a few comments  related to  this draft  permit.

Page 26 -S5E1e Shoreline Posting Requirements
e. Remove all old signs at the end of the period of water use restriction.
This requirement will serve no purpose. I have noticed that most of the signage lake-wide  is removed by the property owners shortly after treatment  Requiring the contractor to come back to the lake after all of the restrictions have expired to remove the few remaining  signs will only add additional costs to our treatment program. All of the water use restrictions are identified on the postings. Once my family is aware of the restrictions I typically remove them anyway.

The Permittee must email a copy of the notice, including the date of distribution, to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR at Todd.Brownlee@dnr.wa.gov no later than one business day following public distribution. The Permittee need not notify DNR for treatments occurring on privately-owned lakes with no public access.

I am against Ecology entering my property without first contacting me and receiving permission. Ecology already has such access through public boat launches. Since the treatment  activity typically takes place in the water and not on my property I am not in favor of allowing any access without first contacting me for approval.

I own lake front property on Lake Debra Jane. I live at 18716 McGhee Dr E Bonney Lake WA 98391 my phone is 425.765.7459.

I completely disagree with the responses forwarded to me to concur. As a licensed PE in the State of Washington I support NPDES requirements for the hired contractor to remove the notices upon a the notification postings. The non response of this in the past leaves the safety of the public at risk and prohibits knowledge of the restrictions.

I also know you need the addresses of the affected. I agree the contractor hired shall submit those to ecology.

Right of entry is granted to my property at all times to inspect as part of the permit requirements with a notice ahead for entry as required by law, the blanket right of entry does not follow the RCWs and requires advanced notice to the property owner to inspect and the proper legal agreements on record. This requirement I agree with those conditions since the contractor should have a QA QC check on issues. 

I have seen several non compliance issues with this contractor and posted complaints. I understand and implement NPDES permit requirements for my living and am aware of all the non compliance issues and complaints for this contractor as well as the fines and penalties and believe that the HOA should get bids on a qualified contractor not bending the rules.

Since we only have until Dec.l8 to give our feedback on this new permit I am forwarding it to the homeowners who have lakefront property that I have e-mail addresses for. I pretty much agree with Doug Dorling's comments to the Department of Ecology on this issue. Doug is our lake biologist who treats our lake when we have problems that need treatment. If you have neighbors who's names are not on this e-mail please share this e-mail with them.

e. Remove all old signs at the end of the period of water use restriction.
On our lake, this requirement is counter-productive.  Lakeside residents routinely remove such signage themselves shortly after treatment is completed.  Requiring the contractor to come back to the lake after restriction signs have already been removed is simply a waste of time and effort., and will result in needless additional expense to lakeside residents.

We received an email document from NWAE regarding making comments about the new NPDES requirements. The following paragraphs from the document are issues that NWAE considers should not be included in the new permitting process. We strongly disagree with NWAE and believe these changes should be included. Our concern is that many private companies do not comply with the permit once it is issued. We live on Lake Lorene, a private lake and a designated wetland in the City of Federal Way. This lake is part of the Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s Creek watershed and feeds directly into the Puget Sound.
What happens on this lake directly affects the ecosystem of Puget Sound. Department of Ecology should have the right to access lakes, public or private, for the purpose of protecting the environment. Without this change private lake owners could violate the provisions of a permit and the Department of Ecology could be denied access to time critical measurements associated with treatment monitoring.
Please feel free to contact us if we can be of any assistance.

There should be an exception that the sponsor organization or the homeowners we work for can remove these signs.\n\n\nThis permit keeps one of the primary tools we have to fight toxic algae blooms as experimental when it is completely operational world wide.  Phoslock is a technology that was developed 25 years ago by the Australian National Science Academy.  It sequesters phosphorus with a nontoxic technology and that lowers the carrying capacity for a lake or pond to develop toxic algae blooms.  The alternatives that are allowed are Alum buffered with Sodium Aluminate, this blend can be extremely toxic to fish and there have been two major fish kills from the introduction of these technologies to Washington Lakes in the past few years.  This has occurred when the buffer Sodium Aluminate is added to the mix.  This compound is extremely dangerous to handle.  There are over 20 published papers in peer reviewed scientific journals that support the operational use of this technology, it should be considered operational so there are alternatives to the more toxic technologies to turn back phosphorus pollution. \n\n\nIn the past decades, Sonar aquatic herbicide has been used to effectively eradicate the invasive aquatic weed Eurasian Milfoil using a whole lake treatment scenario.  This practice would effectively be banned by this permit.  The laws in Washington State prohibit actions that would impair the control of noxious aquatic weeds and not having access to this technology where appropriate would impair Eurasian Milfoil Control Efforts.  In addition, there has been one infestation of Hydrilla in Washington State and that infestation was eradicated using whole lake treatment technology.  If Hydrilla returns, and as a Class A noxious weed its eradication is mandated, this permit will limit the ability to attack this plant.  \n",

Limiting its use could prove detrimental in terms of stopping the spread of M. spicatum as well as hinder eradication efforts of Hydrilla verticillata.  Fluridone is also very effective at managing duckweed (Lemna spp., Spirodella spp.), water meal (Wollfia spp.) &amp;amp; Egeria densa.  The main benefit to using Fluridone is that it kills plants slowly, limiting the chances of removing a significant amount of dissolved oxygen from the water column and contributing to a fish kill.  As one can still purchase these plants through ornamental plant gardens, their establishment &amp;amp; subsequent management and eradication need to be considered.  There are a limited number of effective management tools that systemically attack noxious aquatic vegetation and contribute to long term control, it would severely hinder managers by eliminating the use of Fluridone as it is currently allowed.",

I copy Don's comments and believe this material needs to be added to the Ecology list for phosphorous inactivation products. Gary Darcy president of the Twin Lakes Homeowners Association is out of the country for the next few months but before leaving requested that I make sure his group also is on record in  supporting the addition of iron to the list.  Gary Darcy I believe represents over 500 homeowners.\n \nThanks,\nDoug Dorling\nNorthwest Aquatic Ecosystems\nGary Darcy\nPresident twin lakes Homeowners Assoc.\n\n________________________________________\n\nNathan,\n\nFinely granulated elemental (zero valent) iron has a remarkable ability\nto inactivate soluble reactive phosphorus (orthophosphate) by a process\nof adsorption of the phosphate ion to the reactive surface of zero valent\niron and its subsequent conversion to an insoluble iron phosphate coating\non the surface of the iron particle.  Zero valent iron has been used for\na number of years now for the removal of pollutants (including phosphate)\nfrom groundwater by passing the pollutant bearing groundwater through a\nzero valent iron and sand barrier.\n\nSeveral years ago I imagined that passing finely granulated zero valent\niron particles through a column of lake water would accomplish the same\nthing as passing groundwater through a bed of zero valent iron and began\nto conduct a series of bench tests to validate the concept and perfect\nthe application technique.  The first full scale field experimental\napplication was conducted this past summer in phosphorus polluted Lake\nLorene located in Federal Way.  \n\nThe experimental application involved injecting two hundred pounds (two\nfive gallon pails) of zero valent iron as a thin slurry just below the\nsurface of the 54 acre feet of phosphorus polluted water in Lake Lorene. \nThe soluble reactive phosphorus concentration prior to treatment in Lake\nLorene was approximately 35 ppb.  The soluble reactive phosphorus\nconcentration post treatment was below phosphorus concentration test\ndetection limits as determined by an Ecology certified test laboratory. \nThis below phosphorus detection limit condition lasted for two months\nafter the application of zero valent iron in spite of continual external\nphosphorus loading of Lake Lorene from Joe's Creek's inflowing water that\ncontains very high concentrations (up to 75 ppb) of soluble reactive\nphosphorus.\n\nThere was no adverse impact on pH or aquatic life as a result of the zero\nvalent iron application.  The iron phosphate coated iron particles\nsettled to the bottom of the lake and became incorporated into its\nsediment.  Because Lake Lorene is shallow and aerated there is little\nlikelihood that the iron bound phosphorus will be released back into the\nwater column.  Even if phosphorus was released from sediment under anoxic\nconditions so too would some of the iron become soluble (as ferrous\nions).  When orthophosphate ions and ferrous ions are exposed to\noxygenated near surface (photic zone) water the reduced iron (ferrous\nions) and orthophosphate ions will react to form insoluble iron phosphate\nthus inactivating the phosphorus as a nutrient source for cyanobacteria. \nIron is Mother Nature's natural orthophosphate inactivation chemical. \nAluminum is not.  Furthermore the sulfate ions released during an\naluminum sulfate treatment are alien to the natural composition of lake\nwater and harmful to aquatic life.  Under anoxic conditions sulfate ions\nare reduced to sulfide ions that combine with iron to form insoluble iron\nsulfide thus rendering iron ineffective as a phosphorus inactivator. \n\nFor all the above stated reasons zero valent iron should be included as\nan Ecology approved phosphorus inactivation chemical.  Zero valent iron\nis compatible with and augments natural lake chemistry, is\nenvironmentally friendly, and relatively simple and inexpensive to apply.\n\n\nDon Russell\n\n\n",

The trustees have reviewed your agency&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s draft NPDES permit and herewith submit our comments and concerns related to this draft permit.\n\n\nPage 26 -S5E1e Shoreline Posting Requirements\n\n\n&amp;quot;e. Remove all old signs at the end of the period of water use restriction.&amp;quot;\n\n\nThe current filing costs and permitting fees already exceed the actual labor costs to treat the lake.  This added requirement will serve no purpose.  We have noticed that most of the signage lake-wide is removed by the property owners shortly after treatment.    Requiring the contractor to come back to the lake after all of the restrictions have expired to remove the few remaining signs will only add additional costs to our treatment program.  All of the water use restrictions are identified on the postings. Once our members are aware of the restrictions, they typically remove them anyway.  None have asked us to have the signs removed, and our board of trustees has the enforcement authority to ask our members to remove unsightly signs in a timely manner.\n\n\nPage 27 S5 C6  Notification\n\n\n&amp;quot;6. The Permittee must email to Ecology, at apampreposttreat@ecy.wa.gov, a copy of the notice, the date of distribution, and a list of addresses that the notice was delivered to, no later than one business day following public distribution. The Permittee must email a copy of the notice, including the date of distribution, to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR at Todd.Brownlee@dnr.wa.gov no later than one business day following public distribution. The Permittee need not notify DNR for treatments occurring on privately-owned lakes with no public access.\n\n\nOur board of trustees finds this proposed change to be an intrusion of our members'  privacy.  By demanding the Permittee submit this list to your agency, you are allowing this information to be available to any person or environmental group, locally and nationally, for their own agenda, through the Freedom of Information Act.

We maintain a diligent watch over its maintenance.  As the lake itself resides upon, and is entirely surrounded by private property, we are against Ecology entering our community-owned properties and private properties without first contacting us and receiving permission.   Ecology already has visual access from a roadway, and we could provide access through our private park on request.  Since the treatment activity typically takes place in the water and not on land, we are not in favor of allowing any access without first contacting the Trustees of LMBC for approval. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n/S/\n\n\nRobert S.

      "draft_permit_comments" : "Nathan,\n\nFinely granulated elemental (zero valent) iron has a remarkable ability to inactivate soluble reactive phosphorus (orthophosphate) by a process of adsorption of the phosphate ion to the reactive surface of zero valent iron and its subsequent conversion to an insoluble iron phosphate coating on the surface of the iron particle.  Zero valent iron has been used for a number of years now for the removal of pollutants (including phosphate) from groundwater by passing the pollutant bearing groundwater through a zero valent iron and sand barrier.\n\nSeveral years ago I imagined that passing finely granulated zero valent iron particles through a column of lake water would accomplish the same thing as passing groundwater through a bed of zero valent iron and began to conduct a series of bench tests to validate the concept and perfect the application technique.  The first full scale field experimental application was conducted this past summer in phosphorus polluted Lake Lorene located in Federal Way.  \n\nThe experimental application involved injecting two hundred pounds (two five gallon pails) of zero valent iron as a thin slurry just below the surface of the 54 acre feet of phosphorus polluted water in Lake Lorene. \nThe soluble reactive phosphorus concentration prior to treatment in Lake Lorene was approximately 35 ppb.  The soluble reactive phosphorus concentration post treatment was below phosphorus concentration test detection limits as determined by an Ecology certified test laboratory. \nThis below phosphorus detection limit condition lasted for two months after the application of zero valent iron in spite of continual external phosphorus loading of Lake Lorene from Joe's Creek's inflowing water that contains very high concentrations (up to 75 ppb) of soluble reactive phosphorus.\n\nThere was no adverse impact on pH or aquatic life as a result of the zero valent iron application.  The iron phosphate coated iron particles settled to the bottom of the lake and became incorporated into its sediment.  Because Lake Lorene is shallow and aerated there is little likelihood that the iron bound phosphorus will be released back into the water column.  Even if phosphorus was released from sediment under anoxic conditions so too would some of the iron become soluble (as ferrous ions).  When orthophosphate ions and ferrous ions are exposed to oxygenated near surface (photic zone) water the reduced iron (ferrous\nions) and orthophosphate ions will react to form insoluble iron phosphate thus inactivating the phosphorus as a nutrient source for cyanobacteria. \nIron is Mother Nature's natural orthophosphate inactivation chemical. \nAluminum is not.  Furthermore the sulfate ions released during an aluminum sulfate treatment are alien to the natural composition of lake water and harmful to aquatic life.  Under anoxic conditions sulfate ions are reduced to sulfide ions that combine with iron to form insoluble iron sulfide thus rendering iron ineffective as a phosphorus inactivator. \n\nFor all the above stated reasons zero valent iron should be included as an Ecology approved phosphorus inactivation chemical.  Zero valent iron is compatible with and augments natural lake chemistry, is environmentally friendly, and relatively simple and inexpensive to apply.\n\n\nDon Russell\n",

I live at 18716 McGhee Dr E Bonney Lake WA 98391 my phone is 425.765.7459.\n\nI completely disagree with the responses forwarded to me to concur. As a licensed PE in the State of Washington I support NPDES requirements for the hired contractor to remove the notices upon a the notification postings. The non response of this in the past leaves the safety of the public at risk and prohibits knowledge of the restrictions.\n\nI also know you need the addresses of the affected. I agree the contractor hired shall submit those to ecology.\n\nRight of entry is granted to my property at all times to inspect as part of the permit requirements with a notice ahead for entry as required by law, the blanket right of entry does not follow the RCWs and requires advanced notice to the property owner to inspect and the proper legal agreements on record. This requirement I agree with those conditions since the contractor should have a QA QC check on issues. \n\nI have seen several non compliance issues with this contractor and posted complaints. I understand and implement NPDES permit requirements for my living and am aware of all the non compliance issues and complaints for this contractor as well as the fines and penalties and believe that the HOA should get bids on a qualified contractor not bending the rules. \n________________________________________\nFrom: WILLIAM C FAULK \nSent: Saturday, December 12, 2015 12:20 PM\nTo: amkdavidson@gmail.com; Chris Mayfield; Dan Beebe; Gary Leaf; Jeff Brain; Kelly McClimans; Mark Snell; Marny Weber; maryanne zukowski; Melissa Gubbe; Todd Offner; Wendy Schwartznau\nSubject: 2016 NPDESaft Permit \n \nSince we only have until Dec.l8 to give our feedback on this new permit I am forwarding it to the homeowners who have lakefront property that I have e-mail addresses for.

Perhaps such personal information should only be submitted after a complaint of not receiving such notice has been documented to be true.   \nPage 39 G2 Right of Entry and Inspection\nRepresentatives of Ecology must have the right to enter at all reasonable times in or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to the pollution or the possible pollution of any waters of the state.\nEcology already has such access through public boat launches. I do not want anyone entering my property with my prior consent. Since the treatment  activity typically takes place in the water and not on my property I see no reason to allow access through my property without my prior consent.\n",

The following paragraphs from the document are issues that NWAE considers should not be included in the new permitting process. We strongly disagree with NWAE and believe these changes should be included. Our concern is that many private companies do not comply with the permit once it is issued. We live on Lake Lorene, a private lake and a designated wetland in the City of Federal Way. This lake is part of the Joe&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s Creek watershed and feeds directly into the Puget Sound.\nWhat happens on this lake directly affects the ecosystem of Puget Sound. Department of Ecology should have the right to access lakes, public or private, for the purpose of protecting the environment. Without this change private lake owners could violate the provisions of a permit and the Department of Ecology could be denied access to time critical measurements associated with treatment monitoring.\nPlease feel free to contact us if we can be of any assistance.\nTom and Crystal Moehlman\n",

This permit keeps one of the primary tools we have to fight toxic algae blooms as experimental when it is completely operational world wide.  Phoslock is a technology that was developed 25 years ago by the Australian National Science Academy.  It sequesters phosphorus with a nontoxic technology and that lowers the carrying capacity for a lake or pond to develop toxic algae blooms.  The alternatives that are allowed are Alum buffered with Sodium Aluminate, this blend can be extremely toxic to fish and there have been two major fish kills from the introduction of these technologies to Washington Lakes in the past few years.  This has occurred when the buffer Sodium Aluminate is added to the mix.  This compound is extremely dangerous to handle.  There are over 20 published papers in peer reviewed scientific journals that support the operational use of this technology, it should be considered operational so there are alternatives to the more toxic technologies to turn back phosphorus pollution. 


In the past decades, Sonar aquatic herbicide has been used to effectively eradicate the invasive aquatic weed Eurasian Milfoil using a whole lake treatment scenario.  This practice would effectively be banned by this permit.  The laws in Washington State prohibit actions that would impair the control of noxious aquatic weeds and not having access to this technology where appropriate would impair Eurasian Milfoil Control Efforts.  In addition, there has been one infestation of Hydrilla in Washington State and that infestation was eradicated using whole lake treatment technology.  If Hydrilla returns, and as a Class A noxious weed its eradication is mandated, this permit will limit the ability to attack this plant.

2) Fluridone treatments need to remain a viable option for managers &amp; agencies to use to combat Myriophyllum spicatum.  Limiting its use could prove detrimental in terms of stopping the spread of M. spicatum as well as hinder eradication efforts of Hydrilla verticillata.  Fluridone is also very effective at managing duckweed (Lemna spp., Spirodella spp.), water meal (Wollfia spp.) &amp; Egeria densa.  The main benefit to using Fluridone is that it kills plants slowly, limiting the chances of removing a significant amount of dissolved oxygen from the water column and contributing to a fish kill.  As one can still purchase these plants through ornamental plant gardens, their establishment &amp; subsequent management and eradication need to be considered.  There are a limited number of effective management tools that systemically attack noxious aquatic vegetation and contribute to long term control, it would severely hinder managers by eliminating the use of Fluridone as it is currently allowed.</td>

The current timing windows are very salmon and steelhead centric and scientific literature is replete with information to modify the current timing windows.  For example, current information points to conducting in-water work in the Columbia River once bull trout have migrated to their spawning grounds, but not after they return to the Columbia River.  Secondly, there appears to be no consideration for Pacific lamprey timing windows.  Depending on the scope and location )of a proposed in-water project in the Columbia River, please consider truncating the timing windows to minimize effects to all applicable life history stages of Pacific lamprey.  Lastly, please delineate the process for updating the timing windows in subsequent drafts of the permit.</td>
