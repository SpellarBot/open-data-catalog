The County Fair receives annual support from this fund as it consistently draws in people from across the county and state to our region. This attraction and influx of tourism and culture to the area is a significant economic boost to our local economy. In this cycle funds were also spent within the County Parks Department for infrastructure improvements related to the fair. The two other programs are managed through the county's economic development office: GROW Yamhill County- "You can get there from here."

In this cycle the SIF funded two request one for business expansion and another for infrastructure development. The EDSGP accepts applications annually from January 1st to March 1st. The purpose of this fund is to support on-going operations or projects of local businesses, organizations, government entities and educational institutions that seek to create an economic benefit within Yamhill County. The kind of economic benefit should pertain to economic development, job creation and/or business expansion. In 2014 the EDSGP funded eight grant applications including projects from the cities of Carlton, Dayton and Sheridan. Funding supported business organizations such as the McMinnville Downtown Association, the Newberg Downtown Coalition, Dayton Community Development Association, and the McMinnville Economic Development Partnership. In this cycle there were a few one-time expenditures related to marketing, advertising and networking, local companies such as Oregon Lithoprint, Suite 4 Social, LynkSnap and the News Register. These were strategic activities which allowed Yamhill County to expand the awareness of economic development in our area. Association dues were paid from the fund to Summit Strategies Government Affairs, Mid-Willamette Valley Council of Governments and the Association of Oregon Counties. Some restaurant inspections are paid from this fund to ensure this important service continues. Expenditures were recorded during this period for to help fund the county’s portion of a contracted lobbyist working on the Dundee-Bypass project.
