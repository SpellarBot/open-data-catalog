&acirc;&euro;&cent;Recommendations for prioritizing DEQ responses to odor nuisances.  Response - Having read the preamble report I would suggest that an alternative to evaluating just the number of complaints be used to ensure areas of lower population density are not ignored simply because the number of complaints is low.  Maybe some type of population density vs. complaint reports calculation to arrive at a way to rank the significance of the complaints relevant to the population density.  

 
&acirc;&euro;&cent;Methods to determine what odor control measures are reasonable, including cost or other criteria.  Response - all significant organizations have trade organizations which work to support there industry.  I come out of the roofing industry and ARMA (Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing Association) is the trade organization that does all the research and work in support of that industry.  I believe all other industries have similar organizations and they in turn would be the most knowledgeable about processes and practices that work to abate odor (etc.) and the relevant costs associated with those processes. 

&acirc;&euro;&cent;Ways to encourage early, rapid and informal resolution of odor nuisances.  Response - I good industry is proactive in achieving compliance once an issue has been raised with them.  The problem is the others -  The best method is to show them it can be done.  Therefore - 1. Provide appropriate industry trade organization information to them.   2.

I have read a lot of documents supporting the use as a spray in confined animal facilities to control odor. Barry Peven is a local distributor who lives near Portland, Or. I hope to use this product within two weeks on a chicken "barn" used over the winter but vacated for distribution in pastures this spring on this organic farm near Corvallis. The microbial world holds great promise in agriculture, medicine and food production. It's the future.

| 1368793372  | Bruce      | Bartlett  | bruce@actisdesign.com         | Wash Co Citizen Participation Organization #1 | Oregon | These seem like appropriate and sound approaches to odor nuisances. Regarding compost odors, a primary problem is the requirement to site composting facilities in Industrial-zoned lands. This places it in urban settings where odor problems are multiplied. The importance of commercial-scale composting is critical to the fertility of agricultural lands and actually using/enhancing the land Oregon has protected through its land use process. I strongly urge a solution to the type of problem that Recology has in North Plains at the Nature's Needs composting facility (which makes the BEST, most active compost of any provider in the NW) by lobbying the legislature to permit commercial composting on ag lands in addition to industrial lands. It does not smell any worse than a dairy does.

I would like to add my two bits about the awful odor of backyard burn barrels. This tends to be a community issue in that cities have choices about whether to allow this. Big cities have ordinances, small towns allow burns barrels. This seems to be a small town solution to unwieldy garbage as there is often insufficient community recycling at curbside because of insufficient local funds. To go along with an absolute statewide ban on burn barrels, should be a coordinated statewide recycling effort at all curbs that have garbage pick-up. I live in a small town and there is constant air pollution from locals who insist they have a ???permit??? from local agencies to burn trash in barrels. The enormous quantity of plastic and laminates and chemicals which finds its way into these burn barrels, along with the wood, destroys the local air quality. Burn barrels cook away regularly all summer all over town, from leaf burning to construction site materials incinerated in barrels, to plain old unsorted garbage. Where homes are closer together, these burn barrels are often within twenty or less feet of your windows, hence the acrid smell and particulate carbon seeps into every nook and cranny around windows and doors, affecting not only one???s ability to work in one???s own garden but also stinking up home interiors, contributing to asthma and really dirty air pollution. When one objects to this practice, people challenge you with, ???Well, it???s sure not as bad as the forest fires around here, they put a LOT more carbon in the air!??? or ???I have a permit!??? This is a blatant sidestepping of the issue. The fact remains that burn barrels stink and that the particulate matter they contribute to the air is toxic. | [null, null, null, null] |

My concern is that DEQ did not consider any language to address complaints about odors that have persisted for years but are now the recipient of complaints because homes have been built closer to the source or simply because the public is newly aware that they can voice a complaint to a govt. agency. Such cases seem to me to deserve a slower intervention when the complainer has knowingly placed themselves in an area of potential odors and then begun to initiate complaints about them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [null, null, null, null] |
