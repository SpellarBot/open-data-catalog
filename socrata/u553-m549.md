While in pursuit of knowledge about other world regions, including their histories, economies and world languages, students simultaneously acquire the knowledge and skills to prepare for college and/or careers. Teachers and other adults who make up the learning community forge supportive relationships with students and parents while providing challenging and engaging learning experiences. Our school partners with various community, arts, and business organizations to help students meet success.

We assess our students by challenging them to use what they have learned in creative ways to complete interesting projects. Students, staff, families, and community members all see themselves as part of a team whose main goal is the success of every individual student.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Project-based Learning, Portfolios & Roundtable Presentations, Advisory System, Full-time College Counselor through the College Bound Initiative, and College Now classes at Hunter College.

Bard College partnered with the NYC Department of Education to create an innovative program that enables high school students to move, in four years, from 9th grade through the first two years of college, earning a high school diploma, up to 60 college credits and an Associate of Arts degree upon graduation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | In the first two years at BHSEC, students undertake a course of study designed to provide a grounding in mathematics, science, history, English and foreign language. They participate in a variety of arts classes and complete state requirements in Physical Education and Health. Students' work in the college program builds on their high school studies. BHSEC offers a variety of college courses, as well as the opportunity for students to engage in independent studies of their own design. Students must complete 60 college credits to receive the Bard College AA degree. Our curriculum is designed to enable students to transfer to colleges and universities with up to two years of college credit.   | Chinese (Mandarin), Latin, Spanish                 | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Bard Bulletin online newspaper, Bardvark student newspaper, Art Magazine, Asian Culture, BHSEC Connect, BHSEC Literary Magazine, BHSEC Student Activist Network, BHSEC Student's Union, Book, Break Dance, CAFE performances, Chinese Language and Culture, Current Events, Debate, ECO, Film, Future Doctors and Scientists of America (FDSA), Karaoke, Literary Magazine, MAC (Making A Change), Mock Trial, Model United Nations, Muslim Students Association, Philosophy, Step Team, Swim, Table Tennis, Theater Production, Winter and Spring Concerts, Yearbook                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Basketball, Soccer, Tennis                                         | Basketball, Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball                 | Outdoor Track     | Co-ed Ultimate Frisbee                                                                                     | Student Summer Orientation                                                                                                                  | Students may apply to both schools.
