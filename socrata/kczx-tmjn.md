We are troubled by the reports concerning emissions produced by that facility. We have lived in Orenco Station since 2008 and we have considered Intel a good neighbor. However, the addition of D1X and its companion building, air pollution has become a major concern to area residents. It has come to light that past pollutants have not been monitored adequately and we feel it is imperative that they are in the future. The additional construction of two parking garages housing 6000 vehicles directly across from our neighborhood is also a large concern. Pollution from these vehicles as well as emissions from the new plant could affect area air quality by a significant amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [null, null, null, null] |

| 1381774699  | Jacob           | von Borg  | Jacob@resourcesforhealth.org |                            | OR     | My understanding is that Intel has decided that they want to make more of their product, thus giving them grounds to further contribute to the destruction of the natural environment and degradation of farmland, threatening national security by placing safe and healthy sources of food, water, and air at risk. If that already is not enough grounds to refuse this permit, thereâ€™s more. Although these proposed emissions may be within federal guidelines, there is no available research that can speak to the cumulative effect of Intelâ€™s emissions combined with all other pollutants emitted in the area, especially over the long term, and may have unknown threats to public health. Citizens, especially children, do not want or deserve to be the science experiment for local air pollution. The EPA already shows high levels of air and water pollution in the area. New emissions by Intel will compound the problem when efforts should be underway to reduce pollution. Intelâ€™s history of reporting omissions should be grounds to deny the permit. The company has demonstrated that it cannot be trusted to adhere to requirements or guidelines. Thank you for taking all measures possible to stop or limit or extremely limit future and current emissions by Intel. | [null, null, null, null] |
