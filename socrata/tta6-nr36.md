The Council was created to work with the Department on issues of concern, and to share insights and recommendations that could impact relationships between the Seattle Police Department and the community. Council members work together to create their own agendas, and strategize ways for making police services more responsive to the needs of the community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | SPD Community Outreach                       | Linh Thach                               |                                   | 206-684-7712        | linh.thach@seattle.gov                | Filipino Community Center - 5740 ML King Jr. Way S. |          |            | [http://www.seattle.gov/calendar/?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d103794236, null] |

UPS Road Code focuses on different safety principles each week, from basic instruction to the consequences of risky behaviors such as talking on cell phones, texting or drinking while driving. Throughout the program, teens have a chance to practice what they?ve learned on the driving simulators, which feature a computer screen that serves as a windshield to the program?s interactive animation, a steering wheel and life-like gas and brake pedals.

At the event, teens will have the opportunity to:
? Race the clock in a fun and challenging obstacle course, highlighting morning distractions before school and ways to stay safe
? Test your driving skills with our lifelike driving simulators, presenting real-life scenarios on how distracted driving affects safety on the road
? Sign the national petition pledging safety behind the wheel
? Take the Road Code Report Card to quiz yourself on safe driving knowledge
?
