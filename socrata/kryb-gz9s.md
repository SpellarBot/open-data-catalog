| 1357568080  | ?    Since 2000, most populations have met or exceeded abundance goals in individual years; however, it likely that the majority of the spawning population is hatchery production which would result in abundances of natural origin fish that are well below the Recovery Plan abundance goals set forth in the Recovery Plan. |                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ?   Populations whose abundance in 2010 and 2011 were at or above the Recovery Plan abundance goal include the lower Cowlitz, Coweeman, Upper Cowlitz, Tilton and North Fork Lewis. The Upper Cowlitz and Tilton receive significant numbers of adult hatchery fall Chinook plans; therefore, the majority of the natural origin fish may be offspring of hatchery fish. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

For tule fall Chinook the Coweeman River is comprised primarily of natural origin fish and its abundance has averaged about half the Recovery Plan abundance goal.                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ?
