Closed most Sundays. Nytom's art is deeply rooted within the rich culture of his Makah NW Native American heritage. Every piece tells a story based on a NW legend or on the artist?s own visions and dreams. "With my art, I can give back to my people and help keep our culture alive and vibrant."
Working since the 1970?s, Nytom creates art in his own design style in many mediums including limited editions serigraphs, painting cedar boxes, jewelry, and wood carving. Nytom ? "he who walks around" ? is the adult Indian name of the artist John Goodwin. The late NW artist, Art Thompson, was one of his mentors. His work has been shown in art galleries throughout North America.
Also featured is the work of Peter Dunthorne. Born September 2, 1951 in Mount Vernon, Washington, Peter completed a BFA degree in Graphic Design in 1975 from the University of Washington School of Art. Peter lives with his wife Susan on the Upper Skagit Indian Reservation near Sedro-Woolley. |                                      | Event Coordinator               |                                   | 206.431.1582        | dts@qwestoffice.net        | 4705 W Marginal Way SW | 47.5609  | -122.35209 | [http://www.seattle.gov/calendar/?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d105767330, null] |
