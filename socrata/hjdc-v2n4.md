Facility production supports popular warmwater tiger muskie lake fisheries in seven lakes across Washington State.

It was built by Mayr Bros. Logging Company in 1973, in agreement with WDFW to establish a steelhead rearing program. WDFW took ownership of the facility in 1986. At this time, Long Live the Kings (enhancement co-op) took over operations, started the Chinook program, and increased the coho and chum programs; a rearing pond and small hatchery building was constructed on-site. The steelhead program was discontinued in 1997. Off-channel rearing ponds (seven in total) were added starting in 1991. Grays Harbor Poggie Club took over operations in 2007. Poggie Club members installed vinyl liners in two rearing ponds 2010-2013 to improve fish health.

Hatchery production from this supports freshwater recreational fisheries, as well as ocean commercial and sport, and Tribal ocean and Grays Harbor troll and gillnet fisheries. |                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                  |                     | Grays Harbor | LOWER CHEHALIS   | Washington Coastal     | Grays Harbor County Lead Entity     | 3F21802 220191 H   |                                             | 2012-05-16T10:57:22 |
