## Description

NOTES:
1984: Based on 9 1/2 months of reported data.
1985-1986: Since the Illinois Department of Public Health was prohibited from mandating abortion reporting by a temporary restraining order issued in 1984, these numbers were generated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from voluntary reports submitted by Illinois abortion facilities.
1987-1992: In 1987, CDC turned over the annual voluntary survey of facilities performing abortions to the Department.
1993: No data was collected.
1994: A settlement to the 1984 temporary restraining order was reached in the fall of 1993 that allowed Illinois to resume mandatory reporting of abortions. In May 1994, health care providers were notified of the settlement and the Department outlined reporting requirements, including instructions that information on all procedures from Jan. 1, 1994 on be submitted. However, since only about 1,000 abortion reports were received for the first four months of the year, data for 1994 should be considered incomplete.
Data was last updated on November 5, 2013.
