The Endorsed Budget amount is expected to serve approximately 40 youth who meet the geographic requirements of the SYVPI program. The 2016 Adopted Budget provides additional funding to expand the geographic scope of work readiness grant projects to include projects that serve Seattle youth outside of the SYVPI boundaries. Arts estimates this new funding will provide five to 10 additional grants in 2016, allowing for an additional 40 youth citywide to receive 80 hours of paid training in creative industries.

| ARTS      | Proposed Changes           | Provide Funding for Arts and Ethnic Cultural Spaces          | The Office of Arts & Culture has developed programs to combat the displacement of arts and ethnic cultural spaces, to create cultural affordability, and to support the retention of art spaces in our neighborhoods. The 2016 Adopted Budget provides additional funding to support these efforts, including but not limited to increasing granting initiatives, locating and funding new cultural spaces, and retaining crucial cultural anchors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 256000        | 0.00       | 2501          |

This net-zero adjustment removes three programming positions in order to transition work and funding to the nonprofit. Arts, via their granting process, will award the new LHPAI nonprofit with $400,000, equivalent to the cost of the positions and other programming line items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 0             | -3.00      | 2218          |

| ARTS      | Proposed Technical Changes | Appropriate Funding for Artwork Conservation Program         | In prior years, Arts has directly spent funding from the Cumulative Reserve Subfund Budget Control Level to support their Artwork Conservation Program. In order to better align funding with the work being completed, this technical transaction appropriates funding in an Arts Budget Control Level that is supported by the Cumulative Reserve Subfund. Revenue associated with this transaction is included in the following Revenue Overview section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 187000        | 0.00       | 2220          | 
| ARTS      | Council Changes            | Create a new Capital Arts Budget Control Level               | This item creates a new Capital Arts Budget Control Level (BCL) in the Office of Arts and Culture and transfers funding for cultural space grants and for outside agency capital funding requests into the new BCL. While this action is a net-zero change to the 2016 Proposed Budget, it includes transfers from another department and also within Arts. The first component transfers $1.5 million, which was included in the Proposed Budget in the Finance General department, for the Burke Museum, Nordic Heritage Museum, and Town Hall Seattle to Arts as the administrator of the public benefits agreements with these organizations.
