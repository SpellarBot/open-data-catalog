To say that it is engrained in our livelihood is an understatement. Over the last several decades, we have watched the number of functional dairies in Whatcom County fall from over 1,200 working dairies to less than 100, and a major reason for that is regulatory excess and exorbitant land prices. If the intent of the regulatory bodies is to regulate dairies out of existence with little real science to back up the outlandish claims being made on their behalf, then the least they could do would be to allow dairy operators and landowners to parcel up their land into buildable residential parcels in an effort to recoup the generations of substantial financial and sweat equity that have been invested." m:row_number.a9ns-58n5=2

I grew up in a rural area with a well, and I know clean, healthy, well water is critical to health, especially for children, and to economic well-being because a contaminated well decreases property values significantly. Please ensure that standards are strong to ensure no further contamination, and provision of safe drinking water to all who may have had wells compromised. I support high standards including double lining of lagoons, healthy conditions for animals, providing clean water to anyone whose wells are contaminated, provision of information to those affected by contamination, or who may be affected, in both English and Spanish, regular testing of wells near areas that may face contamination, and monitoring to ensure compliance.                                             | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                            | [null, null, null, null] |
