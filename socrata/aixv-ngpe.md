The use of multiple transceiver devices within a network possessing the capability to receive and transmit radio/TV signals can enable a new method of positioning and navigation. Synchronization of the receiver nodes or of the commercial broadcast towers is not necessary for this method to be effective, thereby opening up an existing planet-wide resource with an established and ubiquitous infrastructure to be used for localization.
