We match female mentors with pregnant teens or teenage mothers who could benefit from an additional source of support and are open to a new friendship. Mentors have the opportunity to spend time with the teen moms and their children on outings focused on bonding and positive parenting and they also spend one on one time with the teen mom. Through these matches, the teenage mothers increase their feeling of self-worth and learn to become more self-sufficient. Research shows that with additional support and motivation, young mothers can avoid further unwanted pregnancies and long-term dependence on welfare. 100% of the young mothers in our program showed measurable improvement in school performance, motivation and attendance after being matched for at least six months.
