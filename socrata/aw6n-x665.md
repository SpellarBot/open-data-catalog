## Description

Austin Energy is proactive in addressing customer needs and regularly monitors customer satisfaction through customer surveys. In recent years, overall customer satisfaction has declined. The variables related to the decrease are customer perceptions of price and value. Customers became more sensitive to price during the heat of 2011 and the weakened economy. The perception of higher prices continued during the rate review, despite Austin Energy providing among the lowest electric rates in Texas. Ratings for Austin Energy reliability and quality remain consistently high. The target overall customer satisfaction is 83/100.
