1. Regarding section 5 of the Waste Prevention and Reuse Programs, entitled, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Education program in schools,&acirc;&euro;&#65533; section B, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;education program must address students in both elementary and secondary schools&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro;&#65533; 

Due to demands on classroom time it can be difficult to add curricular activities beyond what is already required.  We recommend a municipality be able to meet this requirement by incorporating an interactive/educational booth on waste prevention and reuse to their already existing Public Works Week field trip in which all 4th grade students attend.  

2. Regarding section 6 of the Waste Prevention and Reuse Programs, entitled, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Funding or infrastructure support program,&acirc;&euro;&#65533; section C, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Annual funding must be no less than $0.25 per local government unit resident up to 100,000 in population&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro;&#65533;: 

We feel the amount of support listed could be burdensome for a municipality to implement.  Is this dollar amount based on cost examples of an actual event(s) meeting the minimum requirement? For example, in a city with a population of 100,000, it seems excessive to require a $25,000 funding commitment to facilitate a 2 day event.  Does the expected participation level warrant this amount of funding to meet the interest/needs of the public?: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Infrastructure support must result in a reuse, repair, lease, or sharing opportunity that is provided continuously or on at least 1 day per year for every 50,000 in the local government unit&acirc;&euro;&trade;s population&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro;&#65533;

We recommend the minimum funding portion be removed and proof of compliance in holding this event(s) be sufficient. 

Thank you for your consideration on these issues. 

Best,
