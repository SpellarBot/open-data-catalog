| 1393879393  | Bill       | Blank      | blankfamily3@comcast.net |              | Oregon | Speaking from the perspective of recent news articles that clearly document concern of the tank railcars transporting crude oil, valve leaking issues, traffic congestion, and other safety concerns by local citizens, public officials from the local to federal levels, I would think DEQ would revised their original comments and take a hard look at the affect of this decision, and delay implementation until those concerns are addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [null, null, null, null] |

It is immoral and should be illegal to aid and abet in the destruction of the planet for the sake of a very few jobs (mostly temporary, and all unhealthful in some way) and sweetheart financial deals with crooked companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [null, null, null, null] |

CPBR provides a safe and environmentally conscientious workplace paying family living wages for approximately fifty people in North Columbia County. Since its inception, CPBR has consistently been engaged with Clatskanie and the surrounding communities to reach out beyond our own employees and support those communities in which our employees live and raise families. As General Manager, I help direct the vision and goals of the Company, which include at their foundation the safety, security and environmental stewardship of our operations. We have assembled a team of highly skilled and trained professionals to conduct our ethanol and terminal operations and engage all tasks from perspective of how can we anticipate and prevent the unexpected. Furthermore, we train and drill rigorously to anticipate and respond to the unexpected. Whereas the plant might have gotten off to a shaky start with the original developer, since late 2009 the site has a consistent history of developing the full value of the asset and enhancing operational flexibility to ensure economic viability. From four employees in December 2009, the plant has grown and flourished and looks forward to continuing to do so. Both the terminal and ethanol operations are required to provide financial stability, but both also show bright futures and opportunities for long-term financial returns, not only to the owners and employees but to Columbia County and the State of Oregon. I urge you to consider these points in concert with the provisions provided in the Permit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [null, null, null, null] |

The companies stance to Enviromental and safety are beyond any other company I have been affiliated with in the last 22 years of my workplace experiences. As a Operations Manager at CPBR I have had the pleasure to create good relations with FRA, DEQ, ODOT, Coast Guard, ETC. We have had no violations and positive feedback on our compamy practices. At this time we have had no time loss incidents since put back into operation in june of 2011. When allowed to grow as a company in the futrue, i believe that all the right equipment will be put into place for the future expansions. I am very proud of the stances that our General Manger and the Global company have made to be a good neighbor and enviromentally friendly. The jobs that they will bring to the area are needed for the surrounding communities.The economic growth and the skills that our employess are obtaining will help lead to a more secure future.

I can attest to the fact that the company will spare no expense for safety in the plant and its surrounding community. The product that we transload is handled very safely and in a very clean way as not to harm the environment. The company has been good to its employees and always have held the safety of its workers as the highest priority. The company has also been good to the community providing help in terms of materials and services if called for.

I live outside of Clatskanie near the Gorgia-Pacific mill and my parents live less than a mile from Port Westward. I feel that if this is done responsibly that it will bring good jobs to the area and improve the local economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [null, null, null, null] |

We need alternative and/or free-energy sources, and our investments need to support the recovery of our planetary ecosystems. This CPBR permit would not move us in that direction, and in fact every permit allowing expansion of non-renewables is one more nail in our own coffin.
