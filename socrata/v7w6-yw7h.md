| 1445352173  | Carrie     | Nyssen    | cnyssen@lungmtpacific.org       | American Lung Association in Oregon  | Oregon     | American Lung Association in Oregon strongly supports the proposed rules for the Oregon Clean Fuels Program. These rules will move forward our mission of saving lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease. Too many Oregonians are exposed to unhealthy air pollution, in part because of our dependence on fossil fuels. Accelerating the use of clean fuels is a vital public health strategy to reduce exposure to bad air. Taking action to reduce our greenhouse emissions is a health win for our children, the elderly and other vulnerable populations who live with the ongoing challenges of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other chronic illnesses made worse by dirty air. Inaction is not acceptable. Continuing to release greenhouse gases into our atmosphere contributes to warmer temperatures and facilitates the formation of ozone which is harmful for all Oregonians to breathe. Warmer temperatures also means a longer pollen season that affects quality of life for those with asthma and allergies. Air pollution from cars, trucks, buses and freight transportation leads to illness and premature death, especially for those living near busy roadways. The Clean Fuels Program is a vital strategy to address serious public health impacts from air pollution. It will result in the development and deployment of cleaner alternative fuels, reducing Oregonâ€™s unhealthy dependence on polluting petroleum fuels. American Lung Associationâ€™s expertise does not lie in the technical details of the program, but we want to signal our strong support yet again, and urge that the program move forward in a way that results in real reductions in emissions as well as real improvements in our air. Cleaner fuel choices means less pollution, less soot and less smog â€“ and thatâ€™s good for the health of all Oregonians. | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                             |
