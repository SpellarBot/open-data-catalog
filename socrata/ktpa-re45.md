Officers          and         were also present. At       ,     , while patrolling in the 6                 , we observed a red vehicle (            ) parked on the west side of the street. This vehicle drew our attention because a figure was bent over and rummaging in the front passenger seat. His whole body was inside the vehicle except for his feet. Due to the proximity of the nightclubs and bars this area is notorious for vehicle prowls. We stopped just north of the vehicle as the suspect (later identified as      ,        ) exited the vehicle and walked to the trunk of the vehicle which popped open, he removed a black backpack from the trunk and placed it on his shoulder which was strange as he already had a backpack on his back.       was dangling keys and looking at our vehicle suspiciously. I asked how he was doing and replied   ,   we asked if this was his vehicle and he stated 'yes.'       began looking nervous and began stepping away from the vehicle and placed the backpack he had removed on the ground.       was asked where he lived and he stated         ,         I asked why he parked this far south and he ignored the question. I now looked more closely at his hands and observed black burn marks on his thumb and forefinger which is consistent with a crack-cocaine addict. Their fingers burn as they hold a glass/metal pipe to smoke crack-cocaine. In my experience the majority of vehicle prowlers perform this crime to fund their addiction. We asked       what his license plate was and he stated he didn't know. Based on his vague answers and his burn marks I believed this was not his vehicle and I began to exit the vehicle to investigate further. As I opened the door       took off running southbound towards          . Officer Collier looked around the vehicle and observed that the passenger window was smashed open. Officer Collier informed us of this damage. I chased       and observed him drop a bottle of cologne and then some white headphones.       ran into an alley in the                  and was trapped. We took him into custody without incident. Officer Collier and I announced 'Seattle Police stop,' several times and       ignored our commands. I read       his         warnings from my department issued resource card and he stated he understood. I ran his name and he had an outstanding Seattle municipal warrant for      . This warrant was verified. I asked       if he vehicle prowls to fund his crack habit (a crack-pipe was recovered from his person.)       told me that this was the first time he vehicle prowled and he only stole the cologne and headphones that he dropped as he attempted to flee. A/Sgt        screened the incident and arrest.       was transported to the West    . I took digital photos of the victim vehicle including the items that he stole. A business card with the case number was left in the vehicle.       was transported and booked into    .   |

When they returned to the vehicle, the rear right window had been smashed and the listed items were stolen from the         . In addition, some of       's clothing from inside the car had been strewn about the parking lot. Nothing of             value was recovered. No known cameras. No known suspects.

On          at     , I was working for the City of Seattle as a fully uniformed Police Officer driving a fully marked patrol car. I was working as 1E1. At     , I responded to          at 2            E for a shoplift that just occurred. The suspect was described as   ,      ,    /                   ,           ,                ,          ,     /            . When I arrived I contacted         C/            .         said she was stocking the shelves on the south side of the store.         could see two males on the next isle over in the mirror on the        .         saw one of them grab a bottle of                           from the shelf and put it inside his jacket.         went to the front of the store and called for assistance.         stayed at the cash register.         saw the suspect leaving and asked him to take the bottle out. The suspect said he did not have anything and started to walk out.         pointed to his jacket and said that she saw him put it in his jacket. The suspect walked through the doorway and set off the tag sensor.         said 'see, you set it off on the way out, you didn't set it off when you came in.'         told the suspect that he was not welcome in the store anymore. The suspect left the store and stood outside for a few minutes. The suspect then left S/B in the alley between          E and Harvard AV E.         did not follow them.         did not see the suspect take anything else.         said the suspect has been in the store several times before and will call us if he comes back.

| 1432300303  | 201490431  | {On            at approximately 0341 hours, I was working as 1E2 and I was employed by the Seattle Police Department as a uniformed police officer in a fully marked patrol vehicle. I was dispatched to 12           for a vehicle prowl in a parking lot. While at this location I was flagged down by another victim of a vehicle prowl.
I contacted victim/                (          ) and he noticed the rear driver's side window was broken in his vehicle.         parked his vehicle in the parking lot at 12   Pine St. Tunkara parked his vehicle this morning (          ) at           hours and returned to his vehicle this at 0050 hours and noticed the broken window. An estimated replacement cost of the damage is approximately $300.00.
        said he had a leather black        bag stolen from inside the vehicle. The        bag contained two IPAD's valued at $200.00 each, four to five different vehicle keys valued at $200 each, various paperwork, and two rings valued at $300 and $600.         is going to attempt locate the serial number of the IPAD through Apple.         works as an automotive          and had vehicle keys for several vehicles owned by                                    in         . These keys are computer chipped and cost around $200 each to replace. I advised         to locate the vehicle information for each of the keys that were stolen and update the incident number.
       's vehicle was a 20            , WA             . The registered owner of the vehicle is            car dealership. There did not appear to be any security cameras in the area that might have recorded the vehicle prowl. A search for prints and evidence was conducted with negative results. There was no suspect information or any possible suspects.
        was given Seattle Police Department                with the case number of this incident and a SPD victim follow up form to complete with any additional information.
