The body is articulated by using weld material to give the spotty look of the animal. The head is approximately 12" long and it peers down its mouth open, and with long eyelashes. There are ears and horns on its head and there are iron rods of about 4-6" in length that are used to articulate the hairs on the back of the giraffe's neck. The base on which the giraffe sits is made of concrete with stones set into it. The piece was installed at the Honolulu Zoo in 1992.
