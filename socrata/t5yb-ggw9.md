The CSC directs the civil service system for all other employees of the City.  It investigates allegations of political patronage so the City?s hiring process conforms to the merit system set forth in the City Charter.  These commissions will at times improve the City personnel system by developing legislation for the Mayor and City Council. | 379974                           |
