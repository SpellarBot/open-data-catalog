That his/her work protects the well-being of both human and wildlife existence and habitat. He must maintain integrity concerning environmental health and be given autonomy to be protected against legislative influences as well as pressure from industry. In order to achieve this, perhaps as the director requires an assistant, an attorney familiar with both environmental and business law and not just the staff attorney who gets to do all the legal work. This person should be given enough financial and staff support to oversee site projects throughout the state and enough qualified staff to thoroughly maintain the NPDES permits as well as similar projects. The director must have a full collection of qualified staff to support these achievements. He should be selected from an unbiased arena and not affiliated with any businesses that would create a ???conflict of interest??? either financially or prejudice by departing from what is best for the health of the biota or humans from former affiliations. The director must become familiar with project sites like superfund sites, mining sites, hazardous chemicals and situations. The director must familiarize his/herself about Portland???s air problems, river contamination, mining operations, potential of Hanford nuclear problems as well as a thorough briefing on the effects of upcoming ???Cascadia??? earthquake from DOGAMI. The director should also learn about the water problems in Klamath Falls as well as any problems with all Oregon???s rivers and coastal problems. The director needs to become familiar with the problems with how far behind Oregon???s law regarding diesel trucks, exhaust and lack of filtering. Also, the director should know about vehicular greenhouse gas rules against challenges from the auto industry. While the economic considerations should be recognized and handled with care, kowtowing to industry or the PBA should not be in the job description. The director should not be a PR person like Nina de Concini or Alex Liverman. They do not care about the environment or the citizens of Oregon. The director should care about both. Rather look to DEQ employees like Kevin Parrett or Matt McClincy. Both are qualified and effective. So would Rhett Lawrence of the Sierra Club. Thank you. |

My suggestion is for a different approach altogether. Bear with me as I point out your short-term dilemma: in only a few months this agency will submit budgets to the Legislature. So even if you found the perfect candidate tomorrow, you don't have enough time to bring her on board such that she could make the kind of contribution that DEQ will need, to make their case for the funding they must have. So set aside this nationwide search for now; instead of paying these headhunters their worthy, yet hefty, fees, dedicate some of that money to supporting your new Deputy Director, to whom you granted Full Authority. Crazy idea? Maybe so, but there's a recent precedent. The PDC, the Portland Development Commission, named a new Executive Director last month. After a similar nationwide search, they decided to promote their current Deputy Director to the job, as she was doing such a good job in the interim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Hiring a husband or wife of a current state employee reeks of nepotism and party advancement. The candidate must have skills beyond press and public manipulation, and management skills and must be a scientist with social skills. Such an individual must put the health needs of the public first above industry. This is not a job to keep industry happy.

The old ways - dilution and mitigation - simply aren't going to cut it anymore. Diagnosed and undiagnosed Superfund sites and all their million little brothers and continued high-risk industrial practices will be our demise and have already meant the loss of species, damaged ecosystems, various untimely human cancers, chronic ailments, billions of dollars spent on imperfect clean-up operations, externalized medical costs, loss of revenue and productivity, etc etc. Our ignorance has preceded us and continues to trip us up. We have been cavalier and foolish in our approaches to resource extraction, pollution and waste handling. And hostile towards our scientists and environmentalists. It's gotta stop. I'd like a DEQ Director who knows that and gives a rip and has the savvy and eloquence to truly turn the boat; a Director who can the make the case - to Industry stakeholders, their employees and benefactors, and the State Legislature - for pollution prevention, responsibility for one's mess, and accountability to the Common Welfare. With all my everything I hope you find that person. I am also attaching a file for your recruitment firm. Please direct them to the "Contributors" pages i-iii where they will find a treasure trove of people who are public health and environmental advocates and who may be able to provide referrals, leads, and knowledgable input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
