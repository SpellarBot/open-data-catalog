## Description

A rain garden is a low area that absorbs and filters rain water runoff that comes from roofs, sidewalks, and driveways. Rain runs off the hard surfaces, collects in the shallow depression, and slowly soaks into the soil.  They are usually planted with colorful native plants and grasses. Every little bit helps to conserve water.  Currently we are tracking rain garden bioswale, cistern, and green roofs.
