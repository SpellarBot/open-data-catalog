This growth is measured based on an expected ACT score based on their ISAT score.                                                            |                                     |                                       |                                  |                                    | BELOW AVERAGE             | Student Attainment measures how well the school performed on standardized tests at a single point in time, in this case Spring 2016. This school's scores are compared to national average scores. A 50th percentile score means the school is performing at the same level as the national average school. |                           |                           |                        |                        | MODERATELY ORGANIZED   | This school is ?Moderately Organized for Improvement? which means that the school has both strengths and weaknesses in their culture and climate.
