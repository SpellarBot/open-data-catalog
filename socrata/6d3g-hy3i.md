The basic technique is to image part of the sky with a wide field-of-view detector. Processing algorithms will be developed to detect objects in earth orbit as they pass through the image.

Noise exposure limits can be easily exceeded especially if effective communications through helmet-mounted speakers is required. A multi-faceted approach is proposed to reduce self-generated noise as well as overall helmet-transmitted noise from external sources such as tools. Modeling, analysis, design and initial testing will be performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

These prototypes will be tested using a human model, thermal manikin (TM) and field testing by AFSOC personnel. Our approach provides a fundamental improvement, increasing human-machine coupling, with far reaching benefits in efficiency. This increased efficiency will allow the cooling systems developed to have significant reductions in weight. The resulting systems will be the first in new generation of superior cooling systems. The products being developed are not dependent on specific cooling technologies and benefits any personal liquid cooling system. The technology developed has broad appeal across the DOD and benefits mounted/tethered systems as well as dismounted systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

To manage the heat loads, a thermal management system utilizing two-phase flow will be necessary. It is important to understand and predict the behavior of a thermal management system under all possible mission conditions. The Oceanit technology will quickly and accurately simulate the behavior of two-phase flow cooling systems under a wide range of operating conditions. We propose a combined experimental and numerical simulation approach to develop the technology. BENEFIT: The proposed research will explore the performance of two-phase flow cooling systems and their transient behavior. The technology could be used in commercial aircraft as well as military aircraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Broadband optics are required to collect emitted or scattered light throughout the visible and ultraviolet regions, with minimal spectral and temporal dispersion. The requirement to perform over a broad bandwidth encompassing the entire UV and visible spectra motivates an all-reflective microscope objective solution. Commercially available all-reflective microscope objectives are based on a two mirror aberration-free system introduced by Karl Schwarzschild. The Schwarzschild microscope objective yields an all-reflective aberration-free solution for conventional compound light microscopes; however, it cannot achieve the numerical apertures or sub-micron spot sizes required for confocal microscope applications. An opportunity exists to fabricate, demonstrate and commercialize a broadband, low-dispersion confocal objective that can achieve the requisite numerical apertures and spot sizes for sub-micron imaging. The proposed design will yield significantly improved performance and also manufacturing benefits. This new microscope objective can leverage current confocal microscope development at the proposing company to streamline the commercialization process.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
