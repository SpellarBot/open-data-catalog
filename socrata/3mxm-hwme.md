How  many more people will be hired?

2] The state is not divided equally in potable water availability. The King County region has been blessed with a very large and redundant reservoir system maintained by SPU, and it wasn't cheap, both reservoirs have a very expensive treatment plant and it will be decades to pay off the bonds it took to build them. They estimate supply that will support growth until 2060. Other parts of the state may not be so fortunate.

3] King County also has access to a huge reclaimed water treatment plant in southern Snohomish County, [Brightwater,] many studies have been done to determine if building a distribution system of &quot;purple pipes&quot; would benefit the urban areas... and not one could economically justify the cost of building the system. The potable water is plentiful and cheaper and the pipes for distribution already exist.

4] Expensive reclaimed water sold at a loss just to get rid of it,  versus potable water treatment that has already increased the cost of that utility's rates, would just increase the cost of both utility rates, and I can tell you, as an elected board commissioner, the recession is not over for a lot of our customers who do not want to see any more rate increases.

5] Your new rule should be focused on Eastern Washington where potable water supply is not expected to support growth, and expansion of the potable supply would cost more than a reclaimed water supply. Any requests for more use of reclaimed water in the SPU area should be denied because irrigation needs are seasonal and SPU depends on those customers to keep their rates stable. Dumping water in streams, rivers, or lakes does not pay the bills, and winter dumping could easily cause floods. 

Thank you for considering my comments,

The developer of the homesites in the east Pierce County development where I live uses reclaimed water for their common landscaped areas.  But the developer requires that grass / lawn is planted in the parking strips in front of residential homes, and the developer requires that the grass in the parking strip be continuously irrigated so that the grass does not go dormant during the summer.  The homeowner has to pay for watering the grass in the county right-of-way parking strips.  The homeowner does not have the option of using a reclaimed water source.  The homeowner's only source of water is Tacoma Water.   Reclaimed water or not, the choice of plants required by developers also impacts how much water is used.   The county allows the developers to dictate what type of plants are required in the county right-of-way parking strips in front of residential homes.  And when, like our developer,  the developer chooses grass / lawn, the result is a tremendous waste of irrigation water (and a large utility bill for each homeowner) when compared to the amount of water needed to irrigate drought tolerant plants or other non-plant landscape material like rocks and bark.

The potable water is plentiful and cheaper and the pipes for distribution already exist. 4] Expensive reclaimed water sold at a loss just to get rid of it, versus potable water treatment that has already increased the cost of that utility's rates, would just increase the cost of both utility rates, and I can tell you, as an elected board commissioner, the recession is not over for a lot of our customers who do not want to see any more rate increases. 5] Your new rule should be focused on Eastern Washington where potable water supply is not expected to support growth, and expansion of the potable supply would cost more than a reclaimed water supply. Any requests for more use of reclaimed water in the SPU area should be denied because irrigation needs are seasonal and SPU depends on those customers to keep their rates stable. Dumping water in streams, rivers, or lakes does not pay the bills, and winter dumping could easily cause floods.

The developer of the homesites in the east Pierce County development where I live uses reclaimed water for their common landscaped areas. But the developer requires that grass / lawn is planted in the parking strips in front of residential homes, and the developer requires that the grass in the parking strip be continuously irrigated so that the grass does not go dormant during the summer. The homeowner has to pay for watering the grass in the county right-of-way parking strips. The homeowner does not have the option of using a reclaimed water source. The homeowner's only source of water is Tacoma Water. Reclaimed water or not, the choice of plants required by developers also impacts how much water is used. The county allows the developers to dictate what type of plants are required in the county right-of-way parking strips in front of residential homes. And when, like our developer, the developer chooses grass / lawn, the result is a tremendous waste of irrigation water (and a large utility bill for each homeowner) when compared to the amount of water needed to irrigate drought tolerant plants or other non-plant landscape material like rocks and bark.

Just because you don't know what to do about them does not excuse failing to warn about them. Their presence should cause utilities to think twice before using reclaimed water to infiltrate aquifers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |               |              | CEC are briefly mentioned on page 113 but no guidance is given for users of reclaimed water to evaluate the risks.

Though I do not know if this would be appropriate, I have been looking over the draft and hope to send some comments. Where I now live in Arizona we are very interested in this as most Arizona communities reuse sewage effluent and the state has pretty good rules. https://www.azdeq.gov/environ/water/permits/reclaimed.html There is a lot of research done here. A local group I work with had a good program on this topic recently as interest in direct reuse is increasing. http://cwagaz.org/videos/205-dpr and http://cwagaz.org/images/Reports/RefLib/National%20Trends%20in%20Potable%20Reuse%20Final.pdf Our speaker, Guy Carpenter, spent a lot of time explaining what treatment trains??? for effluent do the greatest removal of CECs yet are cost-effective.

Though I do not know if this would be appropriate, I have been looking over the draft and hope to send some comments. Where I now live in Arizona we are very interested in this as most Arizona communities reuse sewage effluent and the state has pretty good rules. https://www.azdeq.gov/environ/water/permits/reclaimed.html There is a lot of research done here. A local group I work with had a good program on this topic recently as interest in direct reuse is increasing. http://cwagaz.org/videos/205-dpr and http://cwagaz.org/images/Reports/RefLib/National%20Trends%20in%20Potable%20Reuse%20Final.pdf Our speaker, Guy Carpenter, spent a lot of time explaining what treatment trains??? for effluent do the greatest removal of CECs yet are cost-effective. One thing I was amazed at in the speaker???s presentation was that the water reused for a ???form??? of direct reuse in Texas was cleaner than the surface water it was blended.
