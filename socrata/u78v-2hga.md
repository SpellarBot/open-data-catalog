Tile drainage is a known discharge to surface water.

The permit does not stipulate what to do when subsurface drainage air vents are within the CAFO facility.  There should be at least a 100-ft buffer zone around each vent.  Again many CAFO sites in the Yakima Valley have air vents, even within the animal confinement areas, into which wasterwater can enter the subsurface drainage systems.

series e:u78v-2hga d:2015-08-19T21:36:07.000Z t:first_name=Dean t:email=fotc94@gmail.com t:last_name="Effler MD" t:comments="Although the proposed Washington State Department of Ecology CAFO permit is an improvement on the former, it has some major drawbacks.  Here are a few comments.

1.  Last time the legislature put the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) in charge of monitoring compliance of Best Management Practices and Nutrient Management Plans, parts of the old CAFO permit.  This was a terrible idea.  The WSDA is more interested in promoting agriculture than protecting the environment for the innocent citizens that live near CAFOs.  This arrangement cannot happen again.  The monitoring of this permit needs to be kept in the Washington State Department of Ecology.  How can this be assured???

2.  The EPA study and the recent federal court case between CARE and the five Yakima County dairies show that the voluntary monitoring of soil nitrate levels by the dairies did not work.  The dairies either didn't monitor the soil for nitrogen before manure application or ignored the findings.  They have proven they are not trustworthy in this endeavor.  The only solution I can come up with is that the dairies need to be levied a tax on each head of dairy cow.  This tax should be used to hire an independent person or company to randomly check nitrate levels in the soil in acreage that the dairies have already tested and found to be within an acceptable range for manure application.  The dairies should NOT BE TRUSTED with this endeavor.  

3.  Since current science and court cases prove that all lagoons without liners leak and are therefore point sources of pollution, I am thankful that the manure lagoons are going to be lined appropriately.  

4.  Since a major problem with leaking lagoons and application of manure beyond agronomic rates is the nitrate contamination of ground water, there needs to be local wells that are tested for nitrate and followed over time to determine trends.  If the dairies say that they are complying with the permit and the nitrate levels in the wells continue to increase clearly the dairies are not complying or the permit process is too weak or there are just too many cows on too little land and no  pollution control plan will contain the contaminants.  It is the ground water monitoring that will show most clearly whether the goals of the permit are working.


5.  It is the wealthy dairies that are responsible for the air and water pollution.  It is unconscionable that the tax payers should have to pay for the monitoring of their practices.  It is also fool hardy, considering the history of this industry,  that they will monitor themselves accurately and adjust their practices to prevent lagoon leakage and over application of manure on land.   There needs to be independent monitoring of their practices and activities.  This will cost money and the tax payers should not have to pay for it.  Since the dairies are the source of the pollution, the  Washington State Department Ecology should encourage the legislature to pass a law to tax the sector of the livestock industry that is not using renewable green pasture to feed their herds.  These industrial livestock producers should be taxed per head of livestock and the funds used too monitor field nitrogen levels and nitrates in ground water.  DO NOT TRUST THE GOOD WILL AND GOOD NEIGHBOR STATEMENTS OF THIS INDUSTRY!!!!" m:row_number.u78v-2hga=2

Waiting for a discharge to happen before permitting a facility, or having to prove that a facility has had a discharge when there is no inspection or access to the property, is not protective of public health or environment, and it does not prevent discharges to groundwater (which is a water of the state)." m:row_number.u78v-2hga=3

Ecology should too!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [image/pjpeg, eaHW9Ffet2mL365z2nDVLAAj_dIiGCIgIElWMZqm7qs, Z:\My Pictures\Dairy runoff going into subsurface drainage through vertical air vent..jpg, 370869] | [null, null, null, null] | [null, null, null, null] |

Here are a few comments. 1. Last time the legislature put the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) in charge of monitoring compliance of Best Management Practices and Nutrient Management Plans, parts of the old CAFO permit. This was a terrible idea. The WSDA is more interested in promoting agriculture than protecting the environment for the innocent citizens that live near CAFOs. This arrangement cannot happen again. The monitoring of this permit needs to be kept in the Washington State Department of Ecology. How can this be assured??? 2. The EPA study and the recent federal court case between CARE and the five Yakima County dairies show that the voluntary monitoring of soil nitrate levels by the dairies did not work. The dairies either didn't monitor the soil for nitrogen before manure application or ignored the findings. They have proven they are not trustworthy in this endeavor. The only solution I can come up with is that the dairies need to be levied a tax on each head of dairy cow. This tax should be used to hire an independent person or company to randomly check nitrate levels in the soil in acreage that the dairies have already tested and found to be within an acceptable range for manure application. The dairies should NOT BE TRUSTED with this endeavor. 3. Since current science and court cases prove that all lagoons without liners leak and are therefore point sources of pollution, I am thankful that the manure lagoons are going to be lined appropriately. 4. Since a major problem with leaking lagoons and application of manure beyond agronomic rates is the nitrate contamination of ground water, there needs to be local wells that are tested for nitrate and followed over time to determine trends. If the dairies say that they are complying with the permit and the nitrate levels in the wells continue to increase clearly the dairies are not complying or the permit process is too weak or there are just too many cows on too little land and no pollution control plan will contain the contaminants. It is the ground water monitoring that will show most clearly whether the goals of the permit are working. 5. It is the wealthy dairies that are responsible for the air and water pollution. It is unconscionable that the tax payers should have to pay for the monitoring of their practices. It is also fool hardy, considering the history of this industry, that they will monitor themselves accurately and adjust their practices to prevent lagoon leakage and over application of manure on land. There needs to be independent monitoring of their practices and activities. This will cost money and the tax payers should not have to pay for it. Since the dairies are the source of the pollution, the Washington State Department Ecology should encourage the legislature to pass a law to tax the sector of the livestock industry that is not using renewable green pasture to feed their herds. These industrial livestock producers should be taxed per head of livestock and the funds used too monitor field nitrogen levels and nitrates in ground water.

| 1440079857  | Keith      | Grellner    | Kitsap Public Health District | keith.grellner@kitsappublichealth.org | All commercial AFOs (not just CAFOs) that handle/store/treat/utilize manure outside (uncovered and without use of an impermeable pad with leachate collection) should be required to have an operational permit, just like biosolid sites, composting sites, etc. Commercial / large scale operations should not be exempt from operational permits as they are not "family farms". Waiting for a discharge to happen before permitting a facility, or having to prove that a facility has had a discharge when there is no inspection or access to the property, is not protective of public health or environment, and it does not prevent discharges to groundwater (which is a water of the state).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                      | [null, null, null, null] | [null, null, null, null] |

If these measures go into law the farmers who produce food for us will be forced to either go out of business if they cannot afford the implementations. The proposals dont really seem to follow NRCS data or testing at all. It feels like the agency is 'going after' a single ag group. Going way above best available research and standards into a un needed and expensive program. Nearly ensuring the demise of Washington's family dairy farms. The only ones whom will be able to comply will be the large dairies who the state appears not to like any way. Please look at the COnservation Districts and NRCS databases on soil testing and lagoon sealing.

I seems redundant and unnecessesary to have a permit from DOE when lagoons were designed to be safe retention areas for water and manure from dairies. Bureaucracy is not the answer to your concerns. It is good designs from NRCS that were used to this time. It is note right to assume these facilities will fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                      | [null, null, null, null] | [null, null, null, null] |

Occasionally you lose a little air in a tire. Does that mean they are designed to leak? Of course not. Most tires don't leak at all. It is an absurd injustice to state that all dairy lagoons are designed to leak and therefor we are guilty. I spent 28 years in the Army Reserve, was in Desert Storm and spent a year in Afghanistan to protect the American way of life. In America aren't we all innocent until proven guilty? WHERE IS THE PROOF THAT ALL LAGOONS POLLUTE THE ENVIRONMENT? Innocent until proven guilty....
