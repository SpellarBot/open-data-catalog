| 1445006613  | Huckleberry Palmer | huckleberry.r.palmer@gmail.com | I am commenting as a private citizen, resident, and registered voter in Spokane County, in Washington State. I work for the Department of Ecology, but am not affiliated with the Air Quality Program nor the Clean Air Rule. I would very much appreciate a detailed response to each of the concerns presented in the attached file. Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document, L88rdAVrwZHGmg_aYJqngvW_rDM4HBmPT9YNjfryqSs, C:\Users\HPAL461\Desktop\CAR.docx, 15643]         | 
| 1445523737  | Eric Steffensen    | ericsteffensen@bc.com          | There are options for folks to support low carbon power alternatives like Avista's Community Solar program. I'm a participant and fully support this type of program. It gives people the opportunity to walk their talk; however, mandating carbon limits on industry and natural gas suppliers without the vote of the legislature or people is wrong. If a rule is developed it should not require 3rd party verification. Implementation of our nations Clean Air and Clean Water acts via the Title V and NPDES permitting programs have been successful without the additional costs of 3rd party verifications. For years transportation programs have converted from gas/diesel engines to cleaner burning natural gas, but now those entities private and public will be punished for doing the right thing with higher natural gas costs. With the implementation of Boiler MACT regulations there is an incentive to shutdown old biomass boilers and switch to cleaner natural gas boilers; however, this rule will increase natural gas costs and limit natural gas use. "The Clean Air Rule" is a poor title for a rule that is limited to GHGs. This is a GHG limit rule and should be titled accordingly. The last two summers our state air quality has been rated as unhealthy, very unhealthy and even dangerous as a result of major forest fires, not because of GHGs. The clean air priority of state leaders (Governor, DNR and Ecology management included) should be focused on the biggest air quality problem we have (wild fires) and not GHG's. | [null, null, null, null]                                                                                                                                                 |

| 1446030408  | seo plugin         | qabfodkyfgx@gmail.com          | Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at.
